One of the ones he did was in the upper right. It was a molar that was very close to the sensitive root canal area. Umm, and uh, said it was iffy if this would hold or if I'd start to see the pain. I, I am feeling a pretty big amount of pain now Uh, it's extremely sensitive and the. Patient: Feels like. Patient: It's really impacted as well. So I just wanted to figure out if I could talk to somebody and I might need to figure out is there a root canal or something I need to be scheduling for later this week. So give me a call if you don't mind. It's ****-****-**** again, ****-****-****, Thanks. Bye.",80c8ef9b58,,+13039970446,Inbound,Missed,Existing Patient,caller,27,0,51,127

08/11/2025 12:41 AM,"Agent: Hi, Delbert Goldner-Halvorson how are you? Patient: Hey, I'm sorry Roy Skiles C here with my phone in my hand. I don't know how I missed it. Agent: No problem, That's OK, it happens. Patient: It it was. Agent: Umm. So I, I saw that one of those fillings was really deep when Doctor Jim Grady V did them, so I know he was kind of, yeah, preemptively warning you there. Umm. Agent: Got it. Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah, and, and honestly, it was for about two weeks is really sensitive, not like this. So and then it's calmed itself down and then frankly, I've been I've been back East front. We just got back today back to Denver after seven weeks being situated back in New York State and umm, honestly, I mean, I don't know, spicier foods, cold like I, I don't know what, but. Patient: The last week or so. Patient: It's been a little bit more, umm, sensitive and then the last **** hours and, and honestly, I'm like, I'm flossing that area and I, I don't know whether I'm, I might be exacerbating by flossing really hard. I told Doctor, Doctor Jim Grady V, that's what I used to calm it down. He explained to me why. Agent: Yeah. Agent: OK. Patient: The the even junk particles near this tooth was was was inflaming the tooth to respond. He was explaining to me a little bit. Agent: OK. Patient: I have not done as great a job in the last couple weeks of flossing, but I'm not terrible. But at the same time it feels like that's been. Agent: Sure. Agent: Yeah. Patient: It's been getting worse in there. So I was like, well, maybe I need a floss again. So your idea about maybe seeing him and see what's going on. But it's to the point now where any any water, any liquid or, or even it just can't go on that side of the mouth or I feel it. Patient: OK. Agent: Sometimes with these really deep fillings, the nerve is already starting to give out and it just hasn't fully done it and it takes time for it to kind of get to that stage. I would recommend keep flossing, even if it's a little tender or water picking around there, just because we don't want any extra bacteria kind of sitting around that tooth exacerbating it. You're absolutely right in that regard. Agent: Umm. And then as far As for pain management, have you taken anything? Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Agent: Yeah. Patient: I just took three Motrin, which is normally more than what I normally do. Honestly, I do too. So I just took three, put some food in my stomach and I'm gonna see how this goes. I actually, this is gonna sound funny. I was anticipating not calling you My wife was like, you know what, you may just wanna be on their radar a little bit about this. I was gonna let the flossing, which I've done now for three straight days start to. Agent: Uh-huh. Agent: OK. Agent: Sure. Agent: To be honest, I would. Patient: And I don't own a water pig. I'm going out to buy a water pig. This is one of the things we talked to Felix Watsica-Marks and Doctor Edward Ward about, etcetera. Like we do need, I do do need to get a water picker. I will activate that in this area. And then let's, I was gonna say, do I, do I come in and see you guys, we check it out. Or would the natural reaction be like, well, let's finally bite the bullet and it's probably time for a root canal. I don't know. So I'll take your guidance on that. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah, if it was my tooth, I would wanna get it checked just because, you know, if anything is touching and irritating it, it makes me inclined to think you might need a root canal. Now, again, when you come in, Doctor Jim Grady V can test that area, kind of check everything out for you and then give you a better answer. But just based on what you're saying, that's my inclination. So I would rather get you in. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK, then that then I'll do that, that's for sure. Patient: Yeah. Patient: OK. Patient: I can do that. Patient: I can do that. Agent: Umm, so Doctor Jim Grady V does have an emergency appointment available tomorrow at 2:00, if you're able to make that otherwise. OK, I was gonna say otherwise. I can get you in on Tuesday with me. Agent: OK. Agent: For sure. Patient: Uh, let's go to Doctor Jim Grady V on Monday because it's also more, it's timely as well because here we are day, day before. So if you can lock me in at the 2:00, I will move what I've got. I don't have a whole lot honestly, but I'll, I'll meet you guys there, you know, 10-15 minutes before and then we'll, we'll take it from there. Agent: Perfect. We've got you down then. Agent: Yep. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK, amazing. Awesome. OK, so then I'll take my cues from me, from you guys based on the Doctor Jim Grady V, based on that, if he says, hey, you know, do XYZ for the next couple of days or let's just schedule something for just out of curiosity. Umm. He was explaining to me that the root canal is basically a deeper cavity, that it is what it is like things have evolved from the horror stories you hear, but is this a is it still a it's still an invasive thing that's gonna take a couple of hours, I'm assuming to. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Do it correctly or this is just one tooth? What should I anticipate as far as when it gets scheduled? Is it? Agent: Sure, yeah. Patient: How how the gravity of it on me and on this process? Patient: Yeah. Agent: Sure. So the way I like to explain Doctor or the way I like to explain root canals is very similar to how Doctor Jim Grady V explained it to you. You know, when we have a cavity on a tooth, it's basically bacteria eating away at that tooth there. So when it a root canal is essentially a really deep filling because that bacteria has gotten to the nerve of the tooth or or we worked so close to the nerve of the tooth that the to the nerve has kind of gotten irritated, kind of gives up at a certain point and it's like I can't handle. Agent: List anymore. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yeah. Agent: And So what the root canal specialist will do is go basically through the filling area that Doctor Jim Grady V did, essentially get to the nerve of the tooth, clean it out and put a special filling material down where the nerve space used to be. So they're just gonna clean it out, get you, they'll get you really nice and numb. You may be a little sore just because you are a little sore already or you're having sensitivity and discomfort already. But to be honest, you'll feel a lot better once the root canal has been done 'cause the nerve is no longer there. Agent: And that's generally how it will go. Uh-huh. Patient: If I'm brutally honest, if I'm brutally honest, since I since I work with Doctor, since I work with Doctor Jim Grady V. Agent: OK. Agent: Got it. Agent: Sure. Patient: I'm I'm leaning away from that side of the mouth I in anticipation of pain, let alone they may not even say like I'm already doing unnatural things with how I'm drinking and eating, whether it's an ice cream or something hot temperature hot like so I'm sure it will be feel better when frankly, that's a little bit behind me. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Yep, I agree. I would agree with that. And it'll make you, you know, if it's more gum related, which it sounds like there might be a little bit of gum involvement at all. Also, he can clean that out for you, give you a little bit of relief, but the root canal essentially will give you more relief. But again, without testing everything, I don't want to, you know, tell you that you absolutely need a root canal just because I'm not ****% sure what that tooth looks like today. And so when you come in, Doctor Jim Grady V will be able to give you a better idea of that. Patient: OK, got it. OK, awesome. You guys are amazing. So first of all, thank you so much for all of this. So. Agent: My pleasure. No problem, I know tooth pain is never fun. Agent: Yes, Miss Emma Upton Patient: It's all good. So I'll see. I'll see Doctor Jim Grady V tomorrow, too. Thanks for slotting me in. And then, yeah, we'll take it from there and let's see what the next steps are. But thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Patient: Alright. Agent: My pleasure. If you need more anything else, Delbert Goldner-Halvorson just give me a call, OK? Agent: My pleasure. You take care. Bye. Patient: You got it. Thanks so much. Take care. Have a good rest of the day.

08/11/2025 9:12 PM,"Patient: Hello. Agent: Hi, is this Mr. Salvatore Bartell? This is Doctor Jim Grady V calling with ABC Dental. Patient: Hey, how's it going? Agent: Good. Just thought I'd call you back. I know you had maybe some questions about the crown and just see how you're feeling. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: I, I don't know, like if I'm just curious your thoughts on this, But like I'd say like over the last week, the first night it was kind of sore and I took ibuprofen or whatever and then it was like two or three nights, everything seemed to be good and getting better. And I still think it is like during the day, you know, I'm not noticing like pain or anything with it. The sensitivity is still there and I still feel like a little. Patient: I don't know, tenderness when I'm chewing on that side. So I'm just trying to kind of avoid it still. But like at night I'd say is when it feels like it's hurting a little bit more. But I'm also noticing like some pain on the bottom side now. And so I'm wondering if it's just like the bite alignment is off because I still have like a retainer on the bottom that I'm wearing at night that's causing that. So I don't know, four nights I've taken like ibuprofen before bed because I was kind of waking up in the middle of the night with a little bit of soreness. But again, that was kind of mostly on the bottom. So I'm just kind of. Patient: Cents. Or maybe there's some questions you can ask, whatever. Just like I don't want to go and put this permanent crown on if I should do the root canal, but like it's definitely not. Patient: You know, worse than it was before we did the temporary crown either. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yep. Patient: Uh-huh. Agent: OK, yeah, no, great. Thanks for letting me know what I want you to try. Umm, right is it might be the retainer on the bottom pushing harder on the temporary crown when you have you tried not wearing the retainer at all? Patient: Umm, no, I can do that though. Well, I think a couple of nights ago when I woke up with it and it like I hadn't taken ibuprofen before bed, I just took it out. But. Patient: I could probably try that without it for a couple of nights. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yep. Patient: Uh-huh. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Let's see if you take it out and, you know, leave it out for a night or two and then no ibuprofen and then see if you're still experiencing it. It could be just putting pressure on the crown. And then if you're still feeling that, we can talk more like Wednesday or Thursday and just kind of check in and see, hey, is it bothering you? Generally, if you need the root canal, it tends to be more like, umm, that sensation of needing to take like ibuprofen or Tylenol all the time, almost like achy or sore and it'd be almost like 20. Agent: Or 7. Patient: Oh, then. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Uh-huh. Patient: Yeah. Agent: You know, when it's specific to like, oh, at night, it could be just like your bite or your retainer kind of pushing hard on it. That's kind of my hope something is OK on it. I want to obviously be extra cautious too. So let's maybe try that for a night or two and you can let me know, hey, it's feeling better. It's not. And then we can check in again and see, do we wanna see that specialist first? Ideally, I'd like to have you avoid the root canal, but sometimes we do need to do that. But it sounds like you're still doing OK. Patient: Yeah. Agent: At the moment, you know, and it kinda seems like it's on the right trajectory. Agent: Umm, but again, I wanna make sure you're comfortable too, and not, you know, totally miserable. Patient: Yeah, no. And it's nothing. I mean, even at night it's just more of like, annoying than actually like, truly like, painful. I guess so. Patient: And yeah, it does. I mean, like, they feel quite as much. I mean, it's still like a little bit cold. And I think I was Googling and stuff with temporary crowns, they're not as tight. And so you still have some of that. Is that, am I right with that? Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yep. Patient: Uh-huh. Agent: Correct. So sometimes you're still gonna have that and you probably will have some even in the permanent crown for a few weeks. Umm, just because you know how much that tooth has been through, it's gotta heal. My concern is more of like if you're chewing or having temperatures and it hurts, I'm OK with that as long as it's like, uh, it's not the most comfortable, but I can feel it a little bit. That should get better with time. If it's like, Oh my God, it's terrible. I can't even eat on that tooth or I feel it all the time. That tends to be more of the nerve problem. Patient: OK, yeah, I'm feeling pretty good that it's not so just based on that. But yeah, I'll try without the retainer the next couple of nights and then see how that goes, 'cause I haven't done bite guard 'cause she mentioned that. Agent: It'll come off, yeah. Patient: That it could come off. So I haven't been doing that one at all, so. Agent: Yeah, let's see if that helps and then, umm, check in with me either Wednesday or Thursday if you wanna give me a call and just update and then I can ring you back or we can decide, hey, you know, if you're feeling better then we can keep proceeding or if you're like, hey, you know what, umm, it's not feeling better and we can keep the appointment. I think you said Friday and I'll double check for you here. And then either way, if it's Friday, we can always check the bite, adjust it, or make a final plan as to if we wanna put the final one on or decide, hey, we wanna get to the root canal specialist. Patient: OK. Sounds good. Well, I'll give you a call back then on like Wednesday or Thursday. Agent: Cool. And I'm glad you're going on the right track. It sounds like, right? But let's, uh, make sure of it, OK? Patient: Alright, sounds good. Thank you so much. Agent: Yeah, take care. Have a great day. Patient: OK, you too. Bye.

Patient: We can't process this claim until we obtain additional information. That was for the two services on 7/15. It said we have sent your provider a letter. You don't need to take any action at this time, but we will have to close the claim if we don't receive the information. So somewhere around the end of July you should have received a letter from Cigna asking for more info I think. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: OK. Agent: Yeah. Patient: So I'm just wondering what they need from you guys. Patient: Yeah. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah, right. Exactly. Umm, accepted for processing.

Agent: Here at the office, physically, we probably would have not received it. It would have been sent to them. So let me go ahead and follow up with our team that takes care of our office and see umm, what what's going on here. It may have been something like umm, you know, a note missing from the dentist like that. So let me let me double check with them and umm I'll get back to you as soon as I get a reply from insurance. They're typically pretty quick, although it is the end of the day, so maybe tomorrow morning umm and then. Agent: Uh. Agent: Oh yeah, absolutely. Agent: OK. Agent: OK.

Patient: So that I know what's happening. I just don't want anybody to get their wires crossed and for them to, you know, close the claim. Yeah. Because this has been a long process. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah, OK, great. Agent: Yeah, I understand that. I I hear you, Casey Ledner Thank you for your patience.

Agent: **** how much I'm sorry. Patient: $****.****. Agent: Did you pay with two different cards? Patient: No, just the card ending in. Patient: So I think what happened was umm. Agent: I'm seeing **** dollars. Patient: Right. And that. Agent: On August 6. Patient: Right, and looks like. Patient: What actually came out of my bank account was $****.****. Did you guys get? Patient: Something that came back or? Agent: ****. Agent: **** you said. Patient: Yeah, $****.****. Agent: That's what came out of your bank. Patient: Yeah. Agent: So. Agent: So do we need that means you owe more if because we posted $****.00 but if we didn't get the ****. Agent: That means we have to. Patient: So so I was talking to Ignacio Reichert-Weimann and and she she set me up on a payment plan. Patient: And. Patient: Maybe that's it for let me let me get her letter. Patient: Maybe. Patient: So. Patient: Uh, OK uh, let's see if patient chooses to pro to proceed. Umm, no payment plan 1/3 to 1/2 down with three to six months auto pay. Patient: I'm I'm. Agent: OK but did she put you on auto pay already or because I don't see any? Patient: I'm thinking she did because only. Patient: $****.**** came out of my checking account. Two guys. Agent: OK, let me go to the. Patient: And that was posted August 7th. Agent: I she didn't put any alert on your account because usually we put alert that you are on auto pay. Let me go to. Agent: Our system see if you are on auto pay. Patient: OK. Patient: Thank you. Agent: Hold on a second. Let me pull up that. Yeah. Patient: Yes. Agent: Which yeah, she pro so did she when I send you that letter saying if you want we can put you on auto pay, right? Is that is that what it is? Patient: Yes. Agent: Yeah, but that doesn't mean she did put you because we have to hear back from you. Agree if you wanna be on auto pay. Agent: OK. Patient: Oh, oh, yeah, for sure. I thought that was, you know, I never got any correspondence for that. So I'm, I'm thinking that's what. Agent: I'm not sure. Patient: Because why would only $****.**** come out in my account? I thought that. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah, Mon Ignacio Reichert-Weimann is here today. I'm gonna ask her once she get off of the phone, but I do not see you on auto pay. Agent: Uh, let me gonna. Agent: Right. Patient: Well, you, you know, I, I do have umm, don't set me up yet for auto pay because umm, I have a re my I just got my retirement health savings plan card and I plan to pay the balance in full. Patient: Umm, when I. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah, we can, Yeah. We're not gonna be able to set you up on auto pay unless we have your credit card, you know, the number, the expiration. So yeah. But I, I can just tell you, you're not set up with that for right now. But what's, umm, what's interesting? Agent: Umm, this came out on August 7th. Agent: That 2 two **** five $0.**** I'm just gonna. Agent: Let's see, So what I see August 11th? No, when I see August 6? Agent: Let me see what does it say here? Patient: So Lala, in addition, did you get anything back from my insurance company? Are they are they paying for one of the one of the crowns? Patient: Has that all been all been sent? I just wanna get a final tally of what I have to pay out of pocket. Patient: With the insurance. Agent: Well, umm, as of right now, let me see, hold on umm. Agent: We are waiting on insurance to pay $****.00 but we have not received that yet. However, I'm saying if that Visa you didn't make a payment of ****, you only made a payment for **** something we probably have to put that back on you so you will owe more because you you just said there was no $****.00 coming out of your checking account. This one it says. Agent: Visa. I don't know. Agent: Was it over the phone or were you in the office that day? Patient: I was. I was in the office. I was in the office that day. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Patient: Yes. Agent: OK, so I'm gonna have to let me look one more place to see exactly how much that they, they charged you because they could be, you know, they didn't look at the machine how much it took because sometimes you put the full amount and then it will come back saying this is only how much it's charged because umm. So let me go to report really quick here. Agent: Search and we wanna do. Agent: August 6th. Patient: OK. Patient: Uh. Patient: Yes. Patient: OK. Agent: OK. Agent: Yeah, I'm not coming up with anything that they interesting. Agent: I see so upward. Patient: OK. Agent: ****-**** and the Max is I'll put ****. Agent: $****.00. Agent: I found it. So that's exactly what happened. That's what I was afraid. Whoever charged you, they put the $****.00 in the machine, but it says partially approved for ****, two ****. So they didn't look, they didn't change it in our system. So they posted **** instead of ****. So I'm just gonna have to talk to my manager. Make that ****. Agent: Make ****, ****, then you will owe umm, what the difference? Whatever it's about ****, whatever it will be, let me tell you what's the difference between those two. Agent: So **** dollars. Agent: -****. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yes. Agent: $****.**** equal you're gonna owe $****.01 extra. Patient: Right. Agent: Well, it's not extra, but do you know what I mean? They it, they didn't charge you full? Yeah. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. So, umm. Agent: And the machine does that sometime, but you just have to be very careful. See how much the machine approved the card for is not what we put in the machine. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Oh, OK, OK. Patient: Alright. Patient: Alright, so I have a balance due of ****. Agent: ****. Patient: $****.00 and. Agent: $****.01 that is your portion and we're still waiting on $**** on insurance. Agent: OK. Patient: OK. OK. So when, when would you suggest that I pay the balance because I do have my my retirement health savings plan. Do you wanna wait until? Patient: Every year your billing is reflected or what? Agent: No, no, we were supposed to collect it that day. So if you don't, if you want, I can fix your account and then umm. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Do you have the card with you? I can write it down and run it then I will send you statement. Agent: OK. Patient: Yes, because umm, what I'm looking for is to have the $****.**** reimbursed, uh, via my retirement plan. So let me give you a card and if you can run it, that'd be great. Agent: OK. Patient: Bear with me for just a minute. That's gonna be a different card number. Agent: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: I'm glad you called. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Otherwise we would have lost $****. Patient: Yeah, I don't. Yeah. Patient: I don't want that to happen. Patient: OK, hold on, I'll work. What can I do with Microsoft? OK. Patient: OK, so, uh, let me know when you're ready. Agent: I'm ready. Agent: OK. Patient: Now this is a health care payment card. It's ****. Patient: ****. Patient: ****. Patient: ****. Agent: Pay expiration. Patient: 07/****. Agent: OK and then the umm 3 secure digit code in the back. Patient: ****. Agent: Alright, yeah. Agent: Yes, yes. Patient: Can you hold, uh, the phone Just a moment? OK, sorry about that. Agent: That's OK. Patient: OK, well, I'm sorry about that. Agent: That's OK. Agent: Let's see so. Agent: Yeah. Patient: I'm having, I'm having some work done on my gutters. So that was the gutter guy. Patient: Yes. Agent: Yeah umm I got the card number here and uh once we fix that umm I will run that for the rest of the amount. I just wanted you to know on the $****.**** umm the date might show today if we fix that I don't know I have to see how it's. It will go back to the day that we charge it or today so I'm just.

So if you did get that information, I would have gotten who I talked to time and date just to let you know just because so you, I don't know if you wanna call them back, but I believe you do get one implant crown, one bridge and one single single crown, normal crown.

Patient: An initial crown. Patient: No. Agent: Perfect. Thank you. Because there is a seven-year like frequency like if you got this six years ago they wouldn't cover it.

Agent: So it was me, It was me. So 1/3 down. So roughly, let's see **** umm. Agent: Umm. Agent: Divided by three. Agent: So roughly **** down and then we could do at least 2-3 months auto pay, three months MO Max auto draft. Patient: OK, yeah, that. I mean, that sounds good to me. Umm, that should work. No problem. I can definitely have that for Friday. Agent: OK. And are you interested in care credit at all? Agent: Yeah. Agent: Yeah. Agent: OK. Patient: So the thing with care credit is the other dental practice that I had gone to before that I left, they had the information for it and I did like the pre qualified stuff and I didn't pre qualify, which makes sense because I've been trying to build my credit back up, which I've been doing a good job, but and they just didn't pre approve me. So I didn't actually apply because they didn't pre approve. Agent: Umm and OK. Agent: Auto pay. Patient: So I can definitely do the auto pay though, like I have that money to do a third of it on Friday, so that's no problem. Agent: OK, perfect. All right, we will. And then let me look at the time frame again. Just a moment. Umm. Patient: OK. Agent: OK, let's see, we just got this. Patient: OK. Agent: OK, yeah, so that's fine. 7:00 AM is fine. I'm just gonna move it over because it put you in the wrong spot, but that's OK. So we'll probably have you here for California. Umm, I just think it's probably gonna be a good two hours. Umm, and it may, And you know what? If for some reason she doesn't get, you might have to wait a minute to do the fillings because, umm, I just the way that they, like I said, the, umm, the automated system put you only for an hour. I'm stretching you down to two hours. Patient: OK. Agent: And she's gonna start the crown. The first hour is prepping, the second hour is milling because we make our own grounds. I don't know if she's gonna be able to get to the two fillings. But are you are you here or only here Friday or just in case? Agent: All of it. Agent: Oh, let's see. Patient: So like, I could, I could reschedule probably for next week to do, uh, the fillings if that's gonna be easier. Uh, well, as you say, if I could just split it up, like that's OK too for me. Agent: OK, I'm gonna put it all in there, but I'm gonna put a note that you are aware that you may have to, you may have to get reappointed for the fillings. OK, honey. Patient: OK, that sounds good. So if Friday, if they do, uh, only the crown will only be charged for the crown at that point or would it still be both? Patient: Yeah, yeah. Agent: No, that's fine. It's just, you know what you might since you're gonna come in next week, it's gonna be the same I, I otherwise you're gonna have two different auto draft pulling. Patient: OK, so then actually. Agent: I'd rather do 1. Patient: Yeah, I would too, actually. That's a good point. So could we do a different time on Friday? Because I can try to work my schedule around that. Agent: Yeah, the only you know what? Umm, Friday is the only time she has available. Agent: Umm, she might have an elev. Oh, let me look. She might have a noon available, but I won't know that until tomorrow. Patient: Alright, OK, And can you give me a call tomorrow then and then we can kind of, uh, see because I so far if I'm able to do it at. Agent: Actually, you know what? I'm just gonna make the author. I'm gonna make the decision right now just to do it. I'm just gonna do. I'm just gonna swap out blocks. Patient: OK for Southeast for 7:00 AM. Agent: Yeah, so I could put you at, umm, at noon. Agent: Or. Agent: Oh, OK. Patient: OK. Because 7:00 AM now that I'm thinking about it probably would work better because it's before I come into the office. So can we just do because I would rather do I think the top right because that's been an issue for like a while. So we could for sure just do that Friday morning and then I can just do the fillings another time. Patient: OK. Thank you. Agent: Yeah, let me look at the fillings. She now if she can get to the filling, she's going to. But for now, umm, like I said, I'm just gonna put the crown and let her know that she can do the fillings if she feels she can. Otherwise, we'll just reappoint those next week. We'll see you at 7:00 on Friday morning. OK, dear. Patient: OK. Thank you. Thank you, honey. Sorry about the confusion. Agent: Uh-huh. Bye. Bye. You're so you know, you're fine, honey. Thank you. I'm glad I called. Agent: Bye, bye sweetie.

08/14/2025 8:46 PM,"Patient: Hello, it's Doctor Newcomb. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Hi Doctor Newcomb, this is Doctor calling from ABC Dental. I was trying to reach you. I got a message, umm, on August the 7th from you. Agent: Of course. Agent: OK. Patient: I got you. Well, I appreciate your call back. It's not regarding a patient and I just had a couple, I had some questions that were off. Agent: OK. Agent: Oh, got it. Agent: So sorry to hear that. Patient: Uh, a Anyway, so in, yeah, I'm an endodontist from Arvada, umm, and I've been there ****, started the practice with a Rita Fahey of mine and in **** I had to medically retire because I had a tremor that got worse over time and I, yeah, I was Max. It's OK. It is OK. I was maxed out on meds doing an apicoectomy. Agent: Yeah. Patient: And I couldn't get my hand to just stop. And so sometimes I just try to reset it, position it different, didn't work. So my assistant reaches over, graciously, holds my hand, I finished the Apico and then that was it done. Game over. Agent: Oh wow. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: So yeah, so I would, I'm **** now, so it's **** years old when I, when I had to medically retire, umm, and I'm calling because the one thing that saved me was that I had when I was younger. Patient: Had a financial planner that helped and they made sure I had all my disability and health and blah, blah, blah and all that junk and I wound up I had four disability policies and I cashed in. Agent: OK. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: And so I'm reaching out because I switched careers since then and now I worked with, I worked with a big wealth management firm in Colorado and I25 and I'm reaching out to docs. They're, they're, they told me they're like, we want to report because I'm a doc. I had a disability and I actually use the insurance, umm, And so I'm reaching out to docs to kind of make sure they're covered in case something. Agent: Sure, yeah. Patient: Unexpected happened, I I would want you to be OK as opposed to not because the reality is it's probably the one thing that saved me and my family so. Agent: Yeah. Agent: I get that. Patient: I'm a believer so I'm just reaching out to to see where you're at. Patient: Yeah, good. Agent: Yeah, umm, I actually had a phenomenal mentor, umm, through dental school and that was one of the biggest pieces of advice he would give us. I actually currently have two policies already. Agent: Umm. But he, he used to always say it's not a matter of if you're going to use it, it's a matter of when are you gonna use it. Patient: Yeah, it's like car insurance. It's like, well. Agent: Right. Agent: Right. Agent: Absolutely. Patient: Yeah, maybe you won't, maybe you will. But if you need it, you need it. So no, that's, that is good. That's I'd like to hear that. Do you, because we do the wealth management thing. Do you have like a financial planner and do you have all that stuff? OK. Agent: I do. I do, yes. Patient: Alright, good. Agent: Yeah. Thank you. Patient: I am happy to hear that a lot of people don't have that, so I'm happy that you. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yeah, yeah. Where'd you go to school? Agent: It's true, honestly, I was just lucky with some phenomenal mentors that truly helped me set up for success when I started my career. Umm, so? Patient: OK. Agent: Midwestern University in UMM, Arizona. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: I got you. OK, Well, that's good. Umm, yeah, no, that's good. I'm just reaching out. Do you, do you think there's any other docs in your practice that? Patient: Might be worth talking to. Agent: Truthfully. Agent: There there is. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Well no, I think he already has a financial planner and everything as well. I think everyone is pretty well set at our office. Umm, do you mind if I give your information? So we are a part of the DSO entity essentially. Umm, I can give your information to our HR team, see if anyone needs anything. Patient: OK. Yeah, that'd be good because. Agent: And then have them call you if you need if they do need help with some of that stuff. Patient: Yeah, that's, that's fine. Umm And do you guys, here's a question I know at you're at ABC, do they offer like group disability? Do you know? Patient: OK, Yeah. Agent: They do, yes. Actually, technically I guess I have 3 policies because I do have that one too. Agent: Pretty small, you're right. Agent: Right. Patient: Yeah, usually they're, you know, they're not that right? They're, they're OK, They're OK. But you know. Patient: No. Agent: I almost don't even count that one. It's a maybe for an extremely rainy day. Agent: Absolutely. Patient: Yeah. No, no, no, that's good. Now my advice would be as your income goes up, just make sure you keep up in your policy and, and keep just stay on that and umm, you know with do you meet with the financial planner a lot? Agent: Uh, we meet monthly. Agent: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Patient: OK, you're set. You. You sound like you're doing a good job. So good. Patient: Umm. Agent: I know it's, it was one of my biggest fears. So it was good through hy uh, hygiene school first. So for me, I kind of seen the business end from a negative standpoint prior to dental school. And so like I said, I've just had been blessed and lucky with some phenomenal mentors that helped me get set up. Patient: No, I think, I think that's awesome. And then can I could you, what was your last name again? Agent: Missouri. Patient: OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Alright, got you. Alright, perfect. Umm, so can I give you? Agent: Sure. Patient: Can I give you, I'll, I'll give you my contact info or I can call HR too. I mean, I don't I'm happy to reach out. Umm, or you can. Patient: OK, OK. Agent: Umm, I, I know when I've had other vendors that I've wanted to utilize or give the information to, they prefer that I give their contact to HR and then they'll reach out so I can do that. Patient: OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yeah. So how would you you want me to just give it to you now or send an e-mail or what do you want? OK. Agent: Sure, I'm ready actually.

And we got tons of advisors, we've got all sorts of experience and you know, I've been there, done that, so. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yeah. Agent: And how you get that? Yeah, we have quite a few doctors, umm, that mentor within the group now, umm, that have had similar type of scenarios. So I get it. It's a it's a rough time through. Agent: Right. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Absolutely. Patient: Yeah, yeah, no, it's, it's OK. And you just wanna make sure that you're covered and it works for me. We had some other businesses that that COVID didn't do well with.

Hey, I wanted to reach out to you because after speaking with Doctor Josephine Kshlerin she said she's willing to do, uh, Freddie Osinski crown for ****% off. Patient: That's yeah. Let me look at that because Laverne Lesch sent me something too. Patient: Umm. Agent: Oh, what did it entail? Patient: Where was it at? Because she was asking me. Patient: Did umm. Agent: Mm-hmm. So you talked to her about the experience and what's going on? Agent: Then. Patient: British refunded. Let's see. Patient: She just asked me how I had I seen it yet. But hold on, let me see, let me just Google it like this. Patient: OK. Patient: 'Cause, she said. Look at these treatment plans and see if it works for me. Agent: I mean, did she see what you were presented? Patient: Yes. Agent: OK. Patient: And then so that it looks totally different from the one that we've seen. But like that's where I feel like we have the disconnect and it needs to be a better, you know, everybody's on the same page as far as how does this program really work, you know? Patient: Because we've seen. Uh-huh. Agent: Uh, so she, I, I'm looking at the treatment plan. Mm-hmm. So she said **** for the crown and the build up. Agent: Well, that's nice. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: So did she discuss that with Doctor Norma Hodkiewicz? Patient: Is that less than? Is that more than half or? Agent: It's way more than half.

Agent: Umm, let me look here real quick. Patient: Uh-huh. Agent: Actually, you know, I know he we already did that, so I don't know why that's on there again. Patient: OK. Agent: He already had the scaling and, umm, the gingival cleaning, didn't he? Patient: The cleaning, Yeah, I do. Yes, yes, Yes, he did, because we talked about that, yeah. Agent: Oh, OK, good. So let me go in there and take that out because that's silly to even have that in there right now because we already did it. Agent: So I could see that they put you on that plan as well. So umm yeah, 17 divided. I mean that's $****.00. I mean if you do the 17 whatever that we even **** / 2 is ****. Agent: So ****% would have been 8:50 but she lowered it. So just ask her to please put her notes in there. Agent: Saying that she approved this. Patient: OK. Agent: And then I'm gonna run it by Doctor Mrs. Mary Graham-Turcotte as well. She needs to further discuss it. She can reach out to Christian. Patient: OK, we have they have a big meeting today with the ambassador. So I will talk to Laverne Lesch as soon as she gets out.

08/15/2025 3:38 AM,"Agent: Hi, Duane Thiel Patient: Yeah, hi. Patient: OK. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Hi, it's Ms. Lela Toy with ABC Dental. So I spoke with Doctor and he said umm to alternate with Tylenol and ibuprofen. You can try some jaw massages to see if that helps, umm, swishing some warm salt water if there's any inflammation or anything like that. And just do that for the weekend. If it's still really bothering you come Monday, we can get you in umm. Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah, yeah. Because I don't know what, I don't know what they'd be able to do. I mean, I because I had some things like this before, but I don't understand why she had to be like so rough with my jaw. Like, I don't think it was him, it was that other lady. Patient: Yeah. Agent: OK, yeah, because usually when they rebound the fix, it's just popping the floss in and out. That might cause a little pressure, but. Agent: OK, Yeah. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: It was that part when she had the floss and she was pulling down really hard and pushing into my face, like, you know what I mean? Like it was really he knew that I had to get and she was really nice, but like I told her before, like I need to have gentle like. Patient: For my jaw, so I don't know. Agent: OK. Do you have like really tight teeth contacts, like it's really hard to floss there normally or? Agent: No, OK. Agent: Oh. Patient: No, no, it was, it was something like she had to hold my jaw down that I don't know why she had to hold it that hard. Patient: And I couldn't do anything. Agent: Yeah, because usually it's just the floss. Yeah. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Yeah. Patient: I couldn't say anything because of the, he was putting the, you know, the glue or whatever. I didn't want to screw it up. Agent: OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And then it usually hurts later. And now here I am, so. Agent: Yeah, if it's still bothering you next week. Patient: Umm, it wasn't hurting back there, yeah. Agent: Yeah, I'm so sorry about that. Agent: Umm. Patient: Yeah, I just never know when that's gonna happen. And that's that's just happened so. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yeah, OK. Agent: It might just be the angle at which they had to hold your jaw, just because it is kind of a very awkward angle to get that permanent retainer back in, and having your jaw open for that long too possibly could have irritated it with the TMJ. So umm, just alternate that Tylenol, ibuprofen, do some massages, and if it's still not feeling good, umm, after the weekend, give us a call, OK? Patient: OK, I'll try that. Alright. Agent: Alright, alright. You feel better, OK. Agent: Have. Patient: Can they have somebody? Well, maybe because when they did the cleaning, they didn't have to do it that hard on my job. So maybe just, yeah, like you said, that angle, I guess. Agent: Yeah, because when they're putting on that fixed retainer, you have to lay someone back at a certain angle and the just to be able to see and have access to the back of your tight teeth like that. It's kind of, it's just such a weird angle. Patient: Yeah, yeah. Agent: Umm, and to keep everything dry so that it stays. It's kind of a hard angle to do so. That could have been part of the reason as well. OK. Patient: If they if they ever do that again, I guess there's no other way to do it then, right? Like I can't, I don't. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Umm, I mean if it's if it comes loose again or if it becomes an issue, we could always talk to Doctor about a clear retainer which might be a better option umm down the line. Patient: Yeah, 'cause I already have. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Retainers. OK, umm. Agent: OK. Patient: Alright, well, I'll just try the I took some ibuprofen. Yeah, Tylenol. I just take that every whatever it says in the bottle, I guess. Patient: Every six hours or something. Agent: Yeah, every six, four to six hours is fine. Mm-hmm. Patient: OK. Agent: OK. Patient: OK. OK. Yeah. Thank you. Agent: Alright, you're welcome. You have a better day. OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Bye. Patient: Alright, thanks. Alright, bye.

08/15/2025 3:53 AM,"Patient: Hello. Patient: Oh, hi. Agent: Hi, this is Doctor Ruben Jakubowski DDS calling from ABC Dental. Agent: Yes. Patient: Yes, hi, I'm Fredrick Baumbach mom. We were in last week. The the one with the seven fillings needed. Umm. Agent: Yes, how are you? Patient: Good. How are you doing? Agent: I'm well, thank you. Patient: Good. You know, I just wanted to check in because you know, I'm. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Yeah, let me. Patient: I don't mean to be little or not, not belittle. I don't mean to to take less seriously her teeth, but like, you know, like Doctor Vicki Lemke is always trying to get me to get something and I feel like he's like we can keep an eye on it. Like how how bad are these feelings? I get a tiny little dots that we have to have all filled. Are they are they you know, I mean, I just kind of felt like that seemed like she was in six months ago with nothing and then all of a sudden there's seven cavities that just seemed crazy to me. Agent: Well, she didn't have nothing last time. They just weren't big enough to put fillings in last time. Patient: OK, 'cause my husband brought her last time so I wasn't Privy to like the discussion. Agent: Oh, I see. OK, OK, OK, that makes more sense. I was gonna say I'm looking at my notes from last time too, and they were definitely there. And we talked about how, umm. Agent: We gotta keep everything nice and clean. Umm, but the whole point was I try not to put, especially my younger patients. I really try not to do fillings if I can help it. Mostly because then you just start this lifelong journey of, OK, my feeling needs to be replaced. OK, it needs to be replaced again. OK, I need a crown. So I try to hold off as much as I can generally. Patient: OK, OK. Agent: Umm, so we have a few of those we've been monitoring. Let me see, umm. Agent: Since ****. Patient: OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Umm. Agent: I know. Agent: I know, I'm so sorry. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Because she, he was like in tears when we laughed and she's like, I'll, I'll, I'll babysit for the MO. I mean she felt so bad. And I was like, jeez, I just, you know, I just wanted to see. I, well, it's not your fault. But like, do you think hormones has anything to do with it? Like, you know how like when you're pregnant, you get, well, I don't know if you've had any kids, but like you, you get like more like all of a sudden my friends all had like 4 cavities, you know. Patient: OK, OK. Agent: Yeah, umm, so hormones is part of it. But to be honest, the biggest effect that is causing a lot of these cavities is gonna be that sparkling water more than anything. Umm, only because kind of like how I explained that drop in the pH allows the bacteria to set into the teeth. If you know you can eat all the sugar in the world, and if you have your mouth at a appropriate pH where it can counterbalance that sugar, you're not gonna see a lot of cavities. Agent: Some patients are genetically more inclined to being that way. Unfortunately, Naomi Halvorson is a genetically more inclined to cavities already. And then you add the effects of sparkling water that just exacerbates cavities in general. Umm. Patient: OK and the on my Coca-Cola, would it be the same thing or is it just the sparkling water? Agent: It's any, any of those major liquids. So like even bottled water, a lot of bottled water, if they're not alkalized, they are umm, they're too acidic for oral environment. Patient: OK, OK. Patient: Got it. OK. Patient: OK. Agent: So a lot of these sparkling waters, the Lacroix, the poppies, those I'm seeing more and more in cafes and younger patients because we're replacing our regular water intake with these sparkling waters. Umm. And so I would argue that it's really that that's exacerbating what she's already prone to. Now, I know lots of patients will come in and they say, you know, I just always get cavities. And it's, yeah, you know, you may be more genetically inclined to get cavities, but you can counter it with your oral hygiene. Patient: Well, he always, yes. Agent: With your dietary care, umm, that sort of thing. And I will say the one thing that I would recommend for Naomi Halvorson is honestly making sure she's brushing and flossing at night because all of these cavities are between the teeth. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: I know. Patient: Yes, I like every night. I'm like, are you flossing? And you know, I'm trying to do that thing with like, it's up to you if you want to have fillings on your front teeth, like, you know, like she's 16 at this point. I can't. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Yeah. Agent: I know it. Patient: Watch over every minute, but like I just I'm trying to figure out like how you know where we are with all this. So the one and the one that's most upsetting is the between your front teeth. Like how I've never heard of that. Like how does like? Patient: Like, in her teeth, they're kind of like they, you know, she bleaches them sometimes. Like, they're not always gonna be the same color. Like, how does that work? Agent: It's so it's tough. I will say it's tough. I would recommend she bleaches her teeth if she normally does that and then comes in about a week after she's done bleaching. Generally speaking, umm. Agent: Generally speaking, if she is. Agent: You know, staying up to date on her bleaching, coming in for her cleaning. The filling should still match. It usually will stop matching. Agent: When patients quit doing what they were already doing routinely. Patient: OK, And how big is the one between her front teeth? Like, is it sorry, I'm getting gas? Is it like, you know, just a dot or is it gonna be something that's like in weird, like if she's in a black light college, you'll be able to see it. Agent: She might be able to. So I took a photo of it and I'm looking at the photo now. The cavity is between the teeth. Now I usually will try to go from the tongue side so that way you can't see the filling, but in her case the cavities do wrap around to the to the lip side of the teeth. Agent: And if you look really closely, you'll see white spots on her front teeth right in between. Patient: OK, OK. So for not I mean it's. Patient: Yeah, I guess. I mean, she's already so self-conscious about her teeth. OK, so then your recommendation was to break it into two separate trips? Agent: Mm-hmm. Yep. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And then, umm, you know, get them bleached to where they need to be I guess by then and then. Patient: Oh, OK. Patient: Alright. Agent: I know, I'm so sorry, I know it's frustrating, but. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Sure. Patient: No, no, no, it's clearly not. You know, I I mean, I had a ton of cavities as a kid, but I kind of had it coming. Like I was a bubble gum chewer and it was the 70s. And, you know, I don't know. I don't think I've flossed until I met my husband. But I have a lot of crowns now, so it's not like I don't have anything to show for it. Yeah. Agent: I know. And that's what I that's what I was hoping to avoid with Naomi Halvorson, which is why we had her on that prescription toothpaste. We were talking about flossing all the time and electric toothbrush all the time with her. And it was quite frankly, to avoid an appointment like what we just had where I have to recommend a bunch of fillings. Agent: Mm-hmm. Yep. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Yeah. And see, I think the mistake was I didn't go with her last time and I don't remember hearing about the two. Like we already have that toothpaste I bought last time. Like she's like, I already have that mom and I don't think she's used it and then. Agent: Because that. Patient: Yeah, alright. Well, alright. Thank you so much for the time and calling me back. Agent: Of course, of course I would. I would suggest UMM in general. We just gotta get her on a regular routine where she's not drinking the seltzer waters all the time. Other than, you know. Patient: Yeah, I don't think she is anymore. Yeah. Agent: Good, like she can still have them, but I would tell her to have them with meals, not to have them just throughout the day because it's really the sipping of these beverages throughout the day that tend to 'cause these problems. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK, so, so yeah, because I'm not paranoid now too. Because like, you know, it's been so hot I've been wanting to drink something besides water. Like totally paranoid, yeah. Patient: As well as yeah, for sure both, yeah. Agent: Well, the difference here, a a little bit of the difference here is gonna be if you're using a waterpik, if you're flossing, you're using electric toothbrush, you know, that's gonna make a huge, huge difference because you're counteracting the presence of that bacteria. You know, there's **** major things that you need in order for a cavity to set it. One is the actual bacteria that eats away at the tooth. Agent: One is the environment needs to be ideal, which is the acidic environment that you get from sodas, you get from umm Lacroix, the sparkling waters, any food you know. Patient: Right. Of course, yeah. Patient: OK. Agent: Fruit will do that like a smoothie will still do that. Umm, so a lot of those beverages really kind of get into the nooks and crannies of the teeth, which is how you end up with those cafes between the teeth. And then the third thing is you need some food for the bacteria that's there. So you have the bacteria is already there. The environment is acidic, so the bacteria is at its optimum level there. And then you add in any kind of sugars or you're not flossing and there's residual sugar or food or bacteria in between the teeth and now that. Patient: OK. Agent: Eating all of that and causing damage to the tea. Agent: So it is a progression. Agent: For sure. Patient: OK, alright, so like even though she has so like she can have a sparkling water and even if she doesn't floss for five hours after that, it still makes a difference. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: The biggest thing I would recommend for her is swish her mouth out with water. Umm, you don't wanna brush your teeth right away because you are in an acidic environment. You want to re neutralize the mouth. Umm, there's a couple of toothpaste tooth, uh, excuse me, mouthwashes that can help with that. Umm, if she's really worried and she wants to use that fluoride toothpaste that she took home, I don't want her to brush it onto her teeth, but she could take a little bit on her finger and rub it onto the teeth. Agent: If she really wanted to. Patient: OK. Patient: Yeah, I always drink water. Yeah. Agent: Umm, but to be honest, the biggest thing I tell patients is once you have one of those meals, liquids, anything, just switch your mouth out with some water. The whole point is just to get it out of your mouth. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: I really hope so for her sake, I know. Patient: Yeah, OK, alright, that, that's the easy thing to do. Yeah, she's just gotta kinda, I think this is a hard Teresa Johnson to learn, but hopefully it it will stick. So alright, well, yeah. Well. And how long do you think the appointment will be for? Like half and half 'cause her schedule's kinda nuts and I've gotta figure out how to not to miss a lot of school. Agent: Sure. Umm, let me, let me, let me see. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Patient: Right. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: So the first appointment would be about two hours and that's where we do the majority of the fillings. I do have a little bit of, honestly, I would say 2 1/2 hours, especially with those front teeth, mainly because I wanna take the time and care to make sure they're blending. She doesn't notice them, she doesn't see them, She doesn't like the color I use. I'll redo them. I want her to be comfortable and confident in what we do on those front teeth. So I would say more like 2 1/2 hours for the front. Patient: OK, alright. And then how late? Agent: Mm-hmm. The second appointment will be significantly faster. Patient: Yeah, and how late do you usually work on the during the week? Patient: OK. Agent: Umm, on Thursdays we're in the office until 5:00 and I'm not in the office on Mondays, but on Tuesday, Wednesday and. Agent: No, Tuesday and Wednesday we're in the office till four and then on Friday we're here until 2. Patient: OK, Alright. Well, great. Well, thank you again. I really appreciate your help. Agent: Of course, I'm always happy to help. If there's anything else I can do, just reach out to me, OK? Patient: OK. Thanks again. Agent: You're so welcome. Agent: Bye.

Agent: Sure. Patient: OK, we have a situation with State of Service 6/9 the hillbilly. Agent: Let me get there real quick, OK? Agent: OK. Is this for you? Patient: To Hildy. Patient: Yes. Agent: Hildy OK, let me get there. Just a moment. Agent: I have 0 balance for healthy. Agent: OK. Agent: Yes, so. Patient: I know because she accidentally paid it, which you should not have done. Agent: Understood. Patient: This this has not been submitted to United Healthcare. Agent: Right. Patient: You submitted it to Delta Dental. Delta Dental claims they are secondary and you send the EOB Explanation of benefits from United Healthcare to Delta Dental. Agent: Let's see where we're at. Looks like primary and secondary are still there. Let's just see how they put it in here. Patient: The primary, according to Delta Dental, is United Healthcare. Patient: Who's they? Agent: Our insurance team that does this, we don't touch it. Agent: We we can look at your Ledger for sure. Umm, OK. Agent: So I'll reverse them and have our team resubmit it all. And let's look at the data service. Patient: Data Services ****. Agent: **** so I'm thinking **** is or **** as well then. Agent: OK, hold on. Patient: I see 22 bills. Agent: Yeah, I see. Just a moment. Patient: **** for **** and the other for ****. Hildy should not have paid those. Agent: Hold on one second. Agent: Umm, ****. Agent: Let me see what insurance paid on that. Patient: An autopay. Agent: Just it's gonna take a minute. There's a lot to look at. OK, Sorry. Thank you, Miriam Reinger OK, I know. I understand. Thank you. Agent: Yeah. Agent: **** and **** is what I'm gonna look at. Six, nine and ****. OK a again, I will reverse those because it looks like in the system, obviously it's the opposite. It's Delta and then, you know, health care. So I'll change those and ask our team to resubmit for 6-9 days of service. And 6/16 she came in for a clean, which they haven't even paid for yet, so because they're probably the same thing. Patient: OK, I see. So yeah, correct. **** with both bills, right? Agent: Yes, Miriam Reinger The six 9 is what I'm concerned with because she paid the **** or whatever it was. Patient: She should not have. Patient: That's why you have a 0 balance. Agent: Yeah. So let me see what insurance, let me send this through again. Now do you have a portal that you go on and look at explanation of benefits or? Patient: No. Agent: Oh, because there I know that you can. So alright, so let's rectify this and see what they say after it's all submitted again, OK? Agent: 1st. Patient: So submit. You're gonna submit to United Healthcare, then we get the explanation about benefits. You will resubmit it today. Patient: Right. Agent: Right, we we show them what United Healthcare right, they, they know what they're doing. I mean they, they should umm, but if it's not in the system right over here. Patient: They shouldn't because they California. They claim Delta Dental was first. Patient: Delta Dental claims it's never been that way if you have any medic. Agent: That's what we, that's what we thought. Mm-hmm. Because that's, I think you guys informed us so. Patient: I don't know. I buy Delta Dental and you guys, according to the government, and I've been on this thing for days. Agent: What government? I mean, what about what? Patient: U.S. government. Agent: Oh, I don't even go there. Patient: Always the UUS government. I spoke to Freddie Walter and he told me that you always have to submit to Medicare first. Agent: Well, I guess that would have been nice to know way back when, huh? Because I'll tell you. How long have you had this? Patient: 20 years. Agent: Yeah. Patient: 10 years, you know. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah. So yeah, we, yeah. So let's just do that. And umm, I'll be sending, sending it over to her name is George Johnson in our insurance group. OK. And we'll see what happens. It's gonna take a minute to get through both of them again. Patient: And then you want me to hold you in? Patient: Oh oh. Agent: No, no meaning. In other words, it was just a pun there. It's, it's gonna be a little bit, it could be two to four, probably 4 weeks before we see anything from maybe two to three weeks for primary and maybe 3 to 6 for the secondary by the time it comes back. Patient: Meanwhile, Hoodie should not have paid this. Agent: Well. Agent: If you don't mind, let's let this process and we'll go ahead and credit everything that's, uh, in the credit in, in, you know, in the parentheses and we'll send it right back to that credit card she used once everything's paid. And so, yes, Miriam Reinger I would appreciate that. I'd appreciate it. We do that and then we can work from the beginning because every time I call. Agent: Hmm. Patient: They said, well you have a 0 balance, we can't submit a 0 balance. Agent: Now who says that we have to go back and go to the claim? And that's where I got you.

So let me see let's see umm, let me see if I can probably we haven't posted.

And do you have any idea how long it takes to return to my account once that's happened? Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: I usually just tell the patient, kinda give it five to seven business days, even though credit card might be a little bit, I don't know since we haven't posted. I honestly don't know what's the process because she's usually the one dealing with that. But I, I think it's just, you know, rule of thumb, just give it like 5 to 7 business days and umm, but I will let her know right now, OK. Patient: OK, that would be fantastic. Agent: I'm glad. Yeah. We catch it. Yeah. OK, perfect. Sounds good. I don't know if it's going through different channels, though.

And the only concern is, is that there's no way for me to have any idea of how much this is gonna cost until after the consultation is done. But the point of this would be for us to do the consultation, go over financials, and then do the surgery all in the same day. Agent: OK. Agent: What time is it at?

Agent: I'm good. How are you? Patient: I am good. I was just calling to let you guys know I'm helping Mrs. Robin Fisher Doctor Durst, have her showing Doctor's offices, so I didn't want to just pop in on you guys. Agent: OK, And is it because I, I think the confusion here and reason I'm calling is because like our Doctor, Teri Dickens is, umm, not no longer gonna be with us in a couple months. And so maybe pause a little confusion. Is it you're showing the office for him to come here or is that something that you're just showing a random office because he's interested in joining ABCd but not sure which office yet? Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah, he is. He's interested in joining us. So I'm just showing him a couple offices knowing that you guys have that opening coming up in a couple months. Patient: Yeah, does, but is it too premature? Agent: OK. Umm, OK. So is that something we should be aware of beforehand to kind of like meet him? Or is it just showing him around? Agent: OK, OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yeah, we're gonna just show him around right now. It's like preliminary. But then if it gets to like he still has to meet with Doctor Casey Bernier and stuff. So when it gets to the point of. Agent: OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: A good candidate's been identified, then the next process will start. I'm just showing him a couple offices right now because it's like really iffy. Like I showed a Doctor an office that sounded really, really good on the phone. Good, good CV, the whole thing. And when I met him in person at Roxboro, it was. Patient: Horrific. And so then it's just easier for us to know if we're gonna move forward or not. Those in person meetups are way better than the phone. Agent: Yeah, that makes sense. OK. Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah. So I like to do that. So I weed out anybody that is absolutely not gonna work out and then then we move on from there. Once we get a couple that we like, then we'll get you guys involved. Patient: Because it's. Agent: OK. Sounds good. Thank you so much. Agent: Yeah. Agent: OK. Patient: You're welcome. I didn't wanna just pop in on you. I'm like, Oh my gosh, I'm just helping Casey Bernier out right now because she just can't get everywhere. And so we wanna find you a really good fit. Patient: So. Patient: I know. Agent: OK, sounds good. Well, I appreciate the more information. I was just curious because I saw it on our schedule and I'm like, what is this? Because I'm not prepared for that. I don't know what's going on. So I just wanted to know what was is gonna be. Yeah. Patient: I know you're like, can these people just come wandering in my office in the middle of the day? Agent: Oh. Agent: Oh yeah. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Yeah, it's like, I get it because I've been, well, I actually retired from PDS, like I worked there like 14 years. So I get the whole thing. And I always used to tell people like, don't be disruptive. They're trying to run their day. Like you can't just pop in unannounced. Like it makes everybody on edge. Well, what's really hard for me is if we're trying to find a doc. Agent: Yeah, yeah. Patient: And the dock is doesn't know they're leaving yet or whatever. Then I'm like, how am I supposed to navigate that? Agent: Yeah. Agent: That's fair. Agent: Uh, got you, got you. Agent: That sounds good. Patient: So usually I have to meet them after hours if that's going on because it's too weird. But yeah, so we're just preliminary now. We want to get you someone that's like the team will love and that produces, you know, all the things. Agent: OK, well, it sounds good. Well, thanks, uh, thanks again for your help.

08/18/2025 10:02 PM,"Agent: Thank you for calling Inspire Dental. This is Lala. How can I help you? Patient: Hi, my name is Milton Kerluke and I'm just calling to apply for an update we've been having. Patient: Some issues with our bill and insurance and I just wanted to check in and see if you had any update to provide. Agent: OK, let me see. What's your date of birth? Patient: Well, it's under my husband's outstanding bill, so his is ****. Agent: Is your husband under your account? Patient: Or ****. Yes, he is. Agent: OK, uh, but what's your date of birth? Patient: 10/15/1980. Agent: OK, because I see through the Let me go to your account and see if I can see him. Agent: Is it Alonzo Torphy? Agent: OK. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: $****. Agent: And then? Patient: They've been submitted to the wrong insurance. I thought it had to be resubmitted and go again. And yeah, it's still showing up and every time I call I get a little bit of a different update. So I don't know if there's someone specifically in billing that I can speak to as I'd like to get this resolved. Agent: OK, so let me just double check. Is it umm, I have Blue CAlonzo Torphy Blue shield and I have Aetna dent, uh, dental. Agent: So. Patient: Yeah, and Aetna should be the one that's paying for it. Agent: So. Patient: And he's paid it. We've been customers there for over 7 years and Aetna is always the one that goes to. Agent: OK. And do you remember who did you talk to? Patient: I've spoken to someone different every single time I've called. Agent: OK. Patient: So that's why I'm wondering if there's someone in billing I can speak to so we can get the results. Agent: Uh, we do have a department for billing and stuff like that. So when anything like this happened they, we usually e-mail them and she's really good about it. Umm, but I'm not sure if we are allowed to. Patient: Is there a way you can send her at? Agent: Yeah, I'm not sure if they do. Patient: Is there a way you could send her my name and number and ask her to reach out to me? So again we could try to get this resolved because I have called both of my insurance companies and they give me very different story. Agent: Let me see this primary insurance. Let me see where this goes. Agent: So I have a note in here, it says that payment should come to the subscriber because we are out of network. Patient: Yeah. And that's not the case. And that's why I'm asking if I can speak to because and then I talked to someone else and I say I agree, that's not the case. Let us rerun it through this is getting. I mean this is now going on for seven months. Agent: Can you talk to your insurance company? Agent: What'd they say? Patient: Yes, yes, I have. Agent: OK. Patient: They say they've never talked to anyone and they have not issued us any money. It Blue CAlonzo Torphy Blue Shield has no record that anyone has called from ABC Dental. And yet when I talk to people, that's what you keep saying. So I need like one person to actually focus on this. We have paid every single time. If you would look back at how our insurance has previously been billed, that is the same process that needs to be followed for this one. Agent: OK, one moment. Patient: It hasn't even been submitted to Aetna. Patient: Yes. Agent: OK, hold on a moment. Please let me umm, check something. OK, hold on. Agent: OK, thank you so much for holding up. I was just reading your note. Umm, whoever talked to you last time, looks like you have talked to Ignacio Reichert-Weimann last time. But she's not here today. So what? I'm and she put in there that she emailed Ross Smitham So what I'm gonna do, umm, I'm gonna talk to Ross Smitham see where she's at as far as this. OK. And I'll. I'll keep you posted. Patient: OK. Can you have Ross Smithamgive me a call? Patient: So. Agent: I'm gonna ask her. I don't know if they allowed to. I'll, I'll, I'll ask her, but I'm just not sure because they're not dealing with patient and stuff like that, that internal as far as uh, claims insurance and things like that, they take care of that. Umm, but I, I will ask her if, if that's something she does, you know. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Yeah. Agent: OK. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK. Yeah. I mean, I hope this is continuing to linger and I would like to get it resolved because I have called my insurance company multiple times and what they tell me is, is very different than what I have heard from ABC. And so I would like again to get this clarified because this looks like an outstanding bill that we have not paid, which and talking to my insurance companies is not the case and that it hasn't even been submitted to them. So again. Agent: OK, question for you. Patient: I was just like to get this resolved. Agent: Question for you. So just so I will make sure Ross Smithamclear with that is the Blue CAlonzo Torphy Blue Shield is the primary and Aetna secondary. Patient: But Aetna is the one who will pay it, so maybe that needs to be switched. Patient: Because. Agent: I understand, I understand. I would just wanna so which one is primary? Which one is secondary? Patient: Well, our primary insurance is Blue CAlonzo Torphy Blue Shield, but for dental it's Aetna. Agent: So what's the Blue CAlonzo Torphy Blue shield? Does Blue CAlonzo Torphy Blue shield is a dental also? Agent: Then it should be OK. Patient: It covers some things, but not for this. And so I just had a cleaning and I haven't received the bill because it was paid correctly. So for whatever reason, it's just my husband and our insurance is exactly the same. So if you want to look at the cleaning that I just had and ensure that it follows that same process for his, then great. Because I have no idea why his is different this one time again, we have been. Patient: Patients there for a very long time. Agent: I understand OK. Patient: And we have never had that issue. Agent: OK, let me talk to her and then I just wanna make sure because there are insurance also, umm, if it's out of network, it's not just yours. They will because we are out of nowhere. They will not pay us. They will pay the subscriber. Patient: OK. But I've confirmed when I've called that your insurance who you cover doesn't change nor has ours. So I understand that, but that should not be the case in this scenario. I understand you have not changed to your carriers are nor have we changed to our insurance carrier is. Agent: OK. But you're saying we do receive payment from insurance? We have received payment from insurance before? Agent: But you are out of network though. Patient: Yes, We have never paid out of pocket for any kind of cleaning and the note that's in there that they get direct. Agent: OK, alright, perfect. I'll, I'll just call her to see where she's at. I'm sure if they already emailed her, she have an idea about this. So I'm just gonna, uh, see what she's at, what she has done, and then hopefully I'll get some answer. Umm, uh, and then if I have to call you back, I will. Agent: Oh, OK. Patient: I'd like a call regardless because again, this keeps getting seemingly pushed back and we've gotten no updates except for me calling and then not hearing anything back. So I would I, you know, need a call back or that I need to be connected with some kind of management to be able to resolve this issue? Agent: OK, sounds good. Let me see what I can do, OK?

Upper, lower, left or right side if I were you. Patient: Right lower. Patient: And also I had. Patient: Something called hyperemesis gravidarum for both kids, which it means that I was unfortunately vomiting for nine months for both and that definitely didn't help my teeth. Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Agent: Any other concerns that you want the Doctor to know about? Agent: OK. Agent: Got you. OK. Patient: No, I would just say like a general check of my mouse because unfortunately when I have a cavity, I don't feel any pain and then I kind of figure out when it's too late. So I may have more, I don't know 'cause I don't feel it. And also, yeah, like a general cleaning. And then I would like also a consultation, just a consultation for now, if it makes sense or not to apply veneer, so. Patient: Something else because I don't have straight teeth at all. So the consultation to see what can it suggest me for the future. Agent: Oh, OK. Agent: OK. And any medical conditions we need to be aware of? Patient: No. Agent: Any artificial joints or heart issues? Patient: No 0. Agent: OK. Agent: Any. Agent: OK. Patient: I'm just the only thing I would say to the Doctor is that I find out with pregnant that I cannot digest or relieve the anesthetic pretty quickly. So like epidural, I had to do it more than one time. Patient: So I kinda get rid of it. Yeah, yeah. Patient: Yeah. Agent: OK, so you go through, umm, anesthesia quickly, OK? You metabolize it quickly, OK, Umm, And are you gonna be working with any dental insurance? Patient: No, I don't think so. Agent: OK. Cash pay. Agent: OK. And would you like same day treatment if we're able to? Agent: Same day. Mm-hmm. OK. Patient: Say again sorry, send date with me. Yes. If you're able to, yes. Agent: Alrighty. And the TE, the tooth that's broke, is it like an it's an original tooth. It's not like a crown or anything like that. Patient: It is an original tooth, yes. Agent: OK, So what I'm gonna do is put the appointment for like an hour and a half so that if Doctor Debra Nicolas is able to do same day treatment, she can do that for you and get you out of pain and get you taken care of, OK? Patient: OK, great. Agent: Umm, so. Agent: Just a couple of housekeeping rules. Umm. Patient: Sure.

So that would be where the $**** balance is coming from, from both those visits with your insurance not paying as much as we expected. Patient: OK, then why? Patient: If I had a look. Patient: Under this thing. Patient: Where it says pay. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And I say view statement. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Does it give me a statement that says $****.****? Agent: Is that online? Patient: Yes. Agent: MMM, I'm only seeing the one or the **** eighty. I'm not seeing a ****, umm, 10. Patient: Well, and I think this is past due. Agent: Umm so I see on July 13th of **** you paid 1 thousand ****. Patient: OK. Agent: That was a that was an old statement. So you you received a statement in July of ****. Patient: Oh, so this statement is from ****? Well, that's. Agent: Yeah. So that's what that **** is. But right now the statement that says the six ****, that one is correct. Patient: But I don't have that statement. How do I get that statement? Agent: Hmm, I can resend that statement to you really quickly. I'm not sure why it's showing you the **** since that one's already been paid. Umm, it would just be the 6:25. Patient: Well, and it's from ****. Agent: Yeah, it could be a glitch in the system. Agent: Umm. Patient: I would. Patient: I would vote for that. Agent: Yeah, that's kind of. That's weird. Hmm. Agent: Alright, it generated a new statement it should be sending to you. I can also e-mail you your account Ledger if you'd like. Agent: OK. Patient: Why don't you eat those two things just to make me happy? Because I think I've been carrying balances forward since. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: I never know what insurance hasn't paid until the next time I come in. Agent: Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah, I will e-mail that to you. Is it Ward? And then? Agent: BARCK at AWOL.

Agent: So I got a chance to talk to Doctor Jim Grady V and he looked, uh, at your X-rays and your chart. He still thinks you, you should go ahead, go see the, the dentist. Umm, if they can do the root canal, then the root canal still is a priority to do on that tooth. Patient: So. Patient: He doesn't think an implant will work. Agent: Well, he said the priority is still for that too is root canal. But if the if the endodontist because they have the specialty, if they think they can do a root canal on that tooth. Patient: I I don't understand. Uh-huh. Agent: Even even if you do implant, he still wants the root canal to be done on that tooth. That's a priority. Patient: How would I do an implant in a root canal on a ****? It doesn't make any sense. If I do an implant I won't need a root canal correct? Agent: Right. But he said he thinks the root canal is still a priority for the tooth. Patient: Ma'am, I don't understand what you're saying. What I'm asking him is instead of doing the root canal, can I just get an implant? Agent: Right. And that's what I exactly asked him too, but that's his response. So I think maybe it's something that in the dentist need to look at it, see if you have a that. Patient: I'm not gonna pay $**** to go to an endodontist.

08/19/2025 4:26 AM,"Patient: Hello. Agent: Hi, this is Ms. Lula Casper This is Doctor Jim Grady V calling with ABC Dental. How you doing? Patient: I'm OK, thanks. Agent: Good. I thought I'd give you a call because I know there's some back and forth with our front team and they just wanted to be able to answer some questions that umm might be easier for for me to help explain over the phone. I know you had some kind of thought if this is a good time for you. Patient: Yeah, that's fine. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: Umm, I know you were kind of questioning, hey, you know, root canal versus should you just get the tooth out and do an implant? You know, my suggestion to you Ms. Lula Casper is, you know, it's a great question. Umm you know, big picture wise, that tooth is obviously a little bit loose and it's lost some bone. But ideally if we do the root canal on that tooth, you know, that should help stabilize the bone and stabilize the tooth long term. Yes, we've already lost some bone on it and it's always gonna be something guarded, but I can tell you for a front tooth like that, we. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: Just wanna try to do everything we can to save a tooth. And generally, you know, the root canal is enough to keep that tooth and you might be able to keep that tooth for life, you know, all else going well and nothing else. You know, umm, strenuous coming up on that front. But you know, an alternative is yes, you could take that tooth out and do an implant. But I will tell you, you know, it's often worth again trying to do the root canal for, you know, 1/4 of the cost sometimes of implants and potentially buying many, many years if not the rest of your life with that tooth. Agent: Ideally, UMM would be better to have a natural tooth than taking a tooth out and doing another implant. You know an implant is an option UMM, but you know, keeping as many natural teeth, especially where you're at at this point, would be the most ideal in my opinion. UMM moving forward. Patient: Well, the reason I was the reason I was contemplating doing that is because initially when I had the bridge work in the in the crown done, she expressed a concern about this significant bone loss as well as you did also. And you know, when I called to get scheduled the appointment with. Agent: Ended on us, the root canal specialist. Yep. Agent: Yeah. Patient: What are what are they called? Sorry. So yeah, thank you. Yeah. It's gonna cost me about **** bucks out of pocket, and that's not including. Agent: Right. Agent: Correct. Patient: If the crown has to be replaced, my insurance won't pay for that because it's been more than **** weeks, right? Or it hasn't been **** months since I had the original work done. So I would have to pay for that out of pocket as well. So M my thinking was if I've got significant bone loss and I do a root canal and I'm gonna have to turn around in another year or two and have to either have another root canal done or the tooth removed and do an implant anyway, I might as well. Patient: Let's go ahead and do an implant. Patient: Umm. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: You can, right? Agent: Yeah, and it's a great question and point, you know, umm, there is that risk, you know, you could go through the root canal and have to replace the crown and you could have to do an implant in a few years. You know, it's hard to know for certain, umm, but my hope would be that they did the root canal. It's the six or **** out of pocket. The crown's intact. You fill that up and hopefully with any luck, you know, you buy many years with that tooth. I can't guarantee it obviously, because I just don't know, umm, you know, but I will tell you the. Patient: MMM. Agent: Us as a complication to the in to the tooth can also be a complication for an implant, you know, it can make functional and aesthetic compromises that we don't necessarily want and want to go down that path either, you know, so ideally, you know, you've put all that work into it, umm, the root canals line of action a but you know, you're right. You could end up back in that same boat, but sometimes, you know, in the bigger scheme you've spent so much and invested so much, you know, I'd love to try to. Agent: Maintain what you have. Umm, obviously I can't guarantee it. And you're right. You're, you completely understand what's going on here. But the bigger picture is trying often to do the root canal. Umm, wouldn't in fact, you know, be more healthy for your natural tooth and keeping that tooth long term, you know, but I would recommend Ms. Lula Casper you know, getting that full consultation with the root canal specialist if you haven't done that portion yet. Umm, and I would see what they think, if they think, hey, you know what, because they often take 3D images. Patient: Yes. Agent: Is if they think, you know, there's not enough bone here, Ms. Lula Casper you're really pushing it. You can ask him that. Hey, what do you think the chances of this thing breaking are? What do you think the chances of this me losing this tooth are? You know, they can't give you specifics and they also can't guarantee it. But maybe if they said, you know what chances are you're not gonna have this tooth in five years, maybe you make that decision and start planning for an implant. If they say, hey, you know what? We think there's pretty good odds here. Umm, my recommendation is always to try to keep your natural tooth. Patient: OK, so I, I've spoken with my insurance company too and they said if the crown has to be replaced, they they can, you could, you guys could send them a code, a pre qualification thing to see what that cost would be. Would would you be able to do that? If I have to do, if I have to go through the framework again and see what, see what they'll cover and what they won't cover and how much that would cost me. So I kind of know where I stand. Patient: If if the root canal doesn't work and I have to get the crown redone. Agent: Yeah, if you have to. If you mean if the root canal breaks the crown. Patient: Well, yeah, if they're not able to do it without having to remove the crown is what I mean. Sorry. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah, if that's the case and you and you wanna call us and let us know, hey, they think that the crown is gonna break or they think that they're gonna have to remove this crown and we can totally send it for pre authorization point. Umm, just to kind of check on it. And if they think, hey, you know what, we should be able to go through the back of this thing without too much issue, umm then you should be OK and say something does chip or break along the way. Then umm, you know I can always send that off to the insurance company and have them check and see what it kinda would be for you cost wise. Patient: OK, one more question with that too. So if. Patient: Am I correct in saying that the bridge work is connected to that crown? Patient: I can, yeah, Yeah. Agent: Umm, that crown is its own unit, so umm, let me just pull up to confirm that. But I believe, umm, you can floss on either side of that too, and it was freely moving. So yeah, that tooth is not connected to your bridge. Agent: No. Agent: And I, and I'll be honest, Ms. Lula Casperagain. Patient: Oh, so I wouldn't have to have that, all that, all that work redone then, right? Well, that's a good thing because I was kind of concerned about that. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK. Patient: Right. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah, that's totally fair. And I'll be honest, I mean, I'm it can happen. I've seen them break with the root canal, but I will tell you it's pretty rare, you know, umm, again, I can't do any guarantees for you, but it's with the material that they have, I don't think it's gonna break on you. Umm, my hope is that's the case. My hope is you get the root canal, the tooth stabilizes up a little bit, and you're back in action. Patient: OK. Agent: But again, I would talk to the root canal specialist and see what they think about it all. Patient: OK. Patient: Alright, well, I appreciate you calling me back and I appreciate the feedback. I just, you know, umm. Patient: I just, I don't want to wind up in the same boat that I'm in right now because again, my insurance won't cover anything any more additional bridge work or crowns or anything like that for, you know, for **** months, which is quite a bit of time. And I don't want to, I don't want to pay all this money out of pocket and then turn around in a couple of years and, and have to pay it out of pocket again. That's my, you know, that's my big concern. Agent: Yeah. And I completely understand that. Yeah. And again, I said, I know you got a lot to think about, but, you know, weigh your odds more with the root canal specialists and and call me back if you have any more questions or if I can help with that too. Patient: OK. I appreciate the call back.

Patient: And I wanted I put this off forever and ever and ever. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And I don't know if I can get in before he leaves my front tooth crown. Agent: OK, let's see. Agent: Alright, now is it a replacement or is it an initial? Agent: OK. Patient: No, it's a replacement. I mean, I've had this one for probably 20 years. This thing has stayed on. Agent: OK, OK, let's do this. Are you wanting to whiten before that or not at all? Patient: Yeah, I think a little bit, yes. Agent: Do you do you have trays yourself or no? Patient: I do have. Patient: Trace. Agent: OK, the only reason why I ask is because I'm looking in your treatment along with the front tooth. It's the chair side whitening for ****. I wasn't sure if you wanted to whiten all your teeth or the chair side and do it with the the light. And then you do you will receive a new custom trays because you're probably gonna need you. Now keep in mind any crowns, any teeth that aren't yours will not whiten like that. So you wouldn't be putting it in the front tooth one that we give you the new tooth. But umm, I don't know. Agent: What you how you wanna whiten? Agent: What procedure? Patient: I guess the one where I did well, I don't know. I don't really want to spend $****.00 of waiting, but. Agent: Trace Do you have gel? Patient: Umm, I just want them whitened. So I have the little, you know, the gel things. Yeah, yes, well, I have one. Agent: OK, so you could whiten we what? Patient: I just have one right now, but I will. Patient: Umm, I think Muriel Schmidt has to go back in. I'll have him buy me a couple more. Patient: Yeah, OK. Patient: No, I'm not. I'm not. No, exactly. Agent: OK, so we just wanna, you know, I'd say about a week, 10 days after you're done whitening, then we'd wanna go ahead and do the crown because sometimes it just takes a minute to, you know, really see how it's gonna react your other teeth and how white they're gonna don't go crazy white because then you're gonna have to keep it up if we match your front tooth. OK? I just always tell patients that I think it's a good idea to do that, but don't forget that you're gonna have to keep that up once you choose that front tooth, that whatever shade that is. Patient: Right. Agent: You will have to keep those other teeth going. I mean, you have to maintain that and keep it white just So what because I just. Agent: OK, Yeah. Patient: Right. Yeah, I'm not. I'm not gonna go crazy, right? Just a little bit. What? You know what I mean? Just yeah. I don't want like when you smile, everyone has to put on sunglasses. I don't like that kind of a way. Agent: No, nor do we wanna see a difference when you because this one's you chose 2 white, you know. Patient: Yes. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Yeah, OK. So how long? Let's see. Agent: Let's see, when does he come in? Let me see. Agent: Muriel Schmidt. Patient: Well, he was just in. I don't know if there's another one scheduled. Agent: Oh, not until January, so you're gonna have to pop in here if you need those. The gel. Patient: OK, OK. Agent: I mean if you have do you have a full 1? Patient: A4. Agent: Well, you said you have 1A gel tube of gel or? Patient: Yeah, I just have a full 1. Agent: OK. Patient: Would that be good to whiten them, Bill Blanda-McGlynn? Agent: That should be fine. I mean, it's up to you. Like I said, how white you wanna go or I don't? Patient: I don't want to go white. White just a little bit, yeah. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Right. OK, so you know, you're an animal. Everybody's enamel is different. So is it? Do you think one would suffice? Agent: OK. Patient: You know, I'll, I'll do it. I'll do the one and then see how it goes.

Like half of it? Agent: AP there. Well, we're hoping they'll pay a portion. Let me just see here. Agent: And this is. Patient: I mean, this is a really old crown. It is old, 20 years old at least. Agent: Now if I were you, it's your front right tooth. Patient: Front left. Agent: Front left. So it's #9 OK, let's see. Agent: Hmm. Agent: It's weird. Agent: OK, just a second. Umm. Agent: Hold on, let's do this. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK. Agent: Let me look what we presented you last time. We just have to put the tooth in front left and. Patient: I'm worried about it coming out. It's been on here for so long and it's as solid as a rock. Agent: You're worried about it coming off then or what? What? Patient: Yeah, I'm worried about it coming off because they're gonna have to. Patient: But you know, knock it off, pull it out, whatever they do. Agent: Oh, what do you mean? Patient: Because, well, because it's, there's nothing wrong with it. It's just not the right.

There's 20 years never falling off. Agent: Oh, I see what you're saying. You're OK. Agent: OK. Agent: Well, let's go back. OK, one moment, there you are. Agent: But it it just looks different than the other ones. Patient: Yes. It's just not a good crown. But I've never just, you know. Agent: Yeah. Agent: OK, so let's go to the documents and see how what we've discussed with you. Patient: And you know what I mean? We'll turn it into the insurance. If they don't pay half, they don't pay half. I just wanna. Agent: Well, right. Patient: He's leaving and I just wanna make sure I did a good a good. Patient: I mean, if my next one lasts 20 years, I'll be dead, so that's good.

Agent: September 5th I know, but we can do all of it in that day or I wanna let you know how insurance works. So if you come in and you do umm, I guess what we could do is do the full exam and then we could maybe do I don't. Did they do a full set of X-rays that the previous office like all like 18 X-rays you recall or one that goes around your head? Agent: OK, so. Patient: I saw them for a few years or like a year or two, so I'm sure they did. Agent: So probably OK, OK. Patient: Yes. Agent: Yes. Patient: I just don't. They sold off the practice and I already didn't like them before. I just tolerated them because they were close and I needed they. They were there when I moved up here. Patient: And but now I'm like, no, I'm gonna build. I can go find somewhere where I actually like. Patient: Because that's all. I hate to do this so. Agent: Right. And you're gonna love us, I promise. I know I have to go in that chair at 1:00 today to get an implant placed. Agent: I I don't. Agent: Oh, got it. Patient: I'm a very puppy, I'm a grinder, so I I'm going to need something. Agent: So it's either September 5th, we could do it, all the work of, you know, your new patient experience, or I mean, you said Wednesdays work better. I mean, you could pop in here tomorrow if you need to. Agent: To it's up. Patient: I can wait, it's not that big of a deal. Patient: Is this? Agent: OK, so let's look at the 5th and that's but see that's Friday and it would be 11:00. Would that work for you or it had to be after after 11? Patient: You're about 10 minutes from where I have gym 'til 11:00 or 10:50. Patient: After 11. Agent: OK. Patient: But uh, you said that should probably be an hour and a half. I have therapy at 4:00. That's the only other thing, so. Patient: Uh, that that should be fine. Patient: Perfect. Patient: OK. Agent: Oh, that's OK. We close early on Fridays at 2:00. So if you're, you know, so long as you have your forms done and I'm gonna send you the portal to you, so long as all your forms are done, we have those X-rays. It's probably gonna be less time, so long as it's a full set of X-rays. Umm. So let me just put you here real quick. Agent: Hold on. Agent: Be right with you. Agent: Let's see. Agent: So that is a 19 at 11, and this is at the Glendale office, OK, the one at **** East Tennessee Ave. Patient: Yes. Agent: OK, because we have more than one location, just wanna make sure. OK, perfect. I have you at 11:00 AM on Friday, September 5. Alright, and call them, get those X-rays over to. Patient: Oh yeah, you're only 7 minutes from again. Patient: Yes.

In the event you ever need to cancel, reschedule appointment, we just asked for at least two business days notice. OK. Otherwise there's like $****.00 fee that we apply to your.

Patient: So last set of X-rays we have is from July 13th of **** and then it looks like. Let me see here. Patient: I'm like, let me see if they took a piano when he was a patient here. Agent: Yeah, because per insurance and I don't know how far it goes back, but we're not allowed to take a full center panel until May of next year. So it's every five years, so. Agent: And maybe you took something without even charging because of this, I don't know when any regardless just to see what you have. Patient: Yeah, let me take a look here. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: So I believe so. I don't think we took a panel. Umm, when he came in, he saw our like another dent dentist that isn't at our office anymore. Umm, the providers here bought it from that old dentist. So it looks like we have X-rays from 20/23/2022 and 20/21. I could send all of those to you if that's something you guys would like. Agent: Well, what do you have on the 23? What do you have? Do you have just bite wings? Do you have I mean, if you don't have a piano, I mean, I'm not saying you're obviously we're different office. If we couldn't get a full mouth or a panel on the new patient visit, we would do X-rays regardless and no charge. So I'm just wondering what you have. Patient: I do see here we have for **** we have about 6 bite wings and then two PAS for the upper and lower. Agent: OK, no, you know what? We need to find that piano. So mm-hmm. Or, umm, I don't know where it is then. It's prior to you guys. So can I ask how long the patient was seen there? Just from when to when? Patient: Yeah. So we first saw him in **** and then the last time we saw him was in **** and that was when Doctor Stam was still the dentist here. Agent: Doctor STANN or N just N1 N. Agent: Oh. Patient: St. AM as in Douglas Nikolaus V and M as in Marion Schimmel Agent: Oh, where it was STEM dental Wellness. So what is it called now? Agent: Oh, OK. Agent: Right.

Yep. Agent: Right, just like us. Yeah. And you guys didn't wanna you. Obviously Nick Sporer-Durgan didn't wanna locate it prior the previous dentist. So I have to go back. Probably one more dentist, I'm thinking. OK. Patient: I would think so. I'm so sorry for that. Agent: Honey Tommie Zemlak it's fine. So I most likely won't be sending this unless they want those, but umm, I have your e-mail. But thank you for your time Tommie Zemlak Patient: Yeah, of course.

Agent: Hi Allen Veum I'm good. Thank you so much for asking. How can I help you today? Patient: OK, I have a billing question. Agent: OK. Patient: And uh. Patient: Because I received the statement from my insurance company and I noticed that for the last visit you overcharged me. Could you please check it? Agent: Yeah, absolutely. What is your date of birth, Alejandro Okuneva Sr.? Patient: ****. Agent: Thank you ****. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yes. Agent: OK, I have not received that insurance from insurance yet. Can you tell me how much you were overcharged or umm how much insurance paid? Patient: And this was July 21st. I mean visit. Agent: Date of service July 21st. Patient: You see it? Yeah, there were two crowns. Patient: And I was charged ****. Can you see it? Agent: Give me a second. Let me get there. Agent: Yes, ****. Yes, Miriam Reinger And it's supposed to be ****, uh, 04. Patient: Because I was charged for build up for the first round that shouldn't be. And actually I told a representative who was frozen that is wrong. And I said no, no, no, no, no, it's totally right. Agent: Yeah, the build up depends on the tooth which would be diagnosed by the Doctor. So in this case they did complete build up. So that's why you were charged for build up. Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Patient: No, no, no. This is not what I said. I mean insurance company for the first crown they do cover build up, for the second they don't. Agent: OK. Patient: And uh, I was included for both. Agent: OK. Patient: I mean you charge for both and I I checked insurance companies they do cover build up for the first round within a year and it has been always the case. This is not the first ground. I checked my previous statements I mean. Agent: OK. So you're saying because this is this is not the first round of the year, it was not covered? Agent: Is that what you're saying? Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK, this is the first. What I said is I had two crowns. The first one was the first crown, the second was the second. So for the first crown they do cover build up, for the second they don't. Patient: And uh, when I was charged, it was charged for build up for both grounds and shouldn't be charged for the first crowd. Patient: Is it clear what I'm saying? Why I'm confused no more? Agent: I'm not understanding. So I I hear I hear that there was 2 crowns. Agent: And both required build up. Patient: Correct. Agent: OK. And insurance will cover the build up for one crown, the first one but not the second one, correct? OK. Patient: Exactly, exactly. You repeated ****% correctly. Agent: OK, So what? What? Patient: But you charged me for both. Patient: Build up. Patient: Yes, yes, yes. Agent: But oh, we charged you for both. OK. So then we need, yeah. So there's a reimbursement, you're saying credit, OK, for the build up for the first crown that was covered, OK. Patient: Where was the same page now. Patient: Yes. Agent: OK. And you have that EOB from insurance telling you that it was covered, is that what you're saying? Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah, I, I opened the mm-hmm and it was always the case. If you look at the previous crowns that they used to have with insurance, they always, uh, covered build up for the first ground always. Agent: OK. Patient: For me, for my life. Agent: OK. So then I do see, I do see a credit here on your account of ****, excuse me, ****. Agent: And $21.00 correct? Patient: Oh, you already received? Agent: I do see it, yes. Did you want that credited? Do you wanna leave that on your account or would you like that sent to you back to the card you paid with? Patient: Yes, I would prefer cars because I don't have any plans for any. I just had several major repairs and Doctor Vicki Lemke said I don't need anything soon. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: OK, I hear you. OK. So then we will go ahead and refund it to the card. The visa that you paid with is does that work for you? Patient: It will be great. Agent: OK. Alright. I will give this information to my manager and you will have this refunded to you. Give it about two to three business days, OK? Agent: Yeah, OK. Patient: Oh, no, I understand. You want to do today. No, no, no, I understand. Thank you so much. Agent: All right. Thank you so much for your patience, Alejandro Okuneva Sr.. We will see you soon, OK. Patient: OK. And thank you for helping me. And it was confusing. Agent: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Thank you for thank you for your patience. Oh, you know what, Alejandro Okuneva Sr.? I see that you don't have a cleaning schedule. Do you want me to help you schedule cleaning? Agent: OK.

For patient engagement and patient portal, press 4. For reporting and analytics, press 5. For CS pay, press 6. Patient: For software support, you have several other options. First, you can access our integrated chat tool with. Patient: Hi, thank you for contacting Cash Tech Support. This is Pedro Mohr How can I help you today? Agent: Umm yes I just wanted to get a better educated on the software. Are you all software that I'm using? I am trying to do insurance verification. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: For, umm, some patients that are already on the schedule, I did not schedule them. So I just wanna be very specific in what's going on, umm. Agent: So they are already on the schedule. I came across one yesterday. Umm, the child is being seen. However, his father is a subscriber. His father is no longer with. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: Is a patient so he's in there as an active but it will not allow me to verify the son's eligibility without. Agent: Activating him again, which is very unnecessary because he's not gonna be seen anymore. So I just wanna know how would you, if I clean slate and just saying I need to add some insurance to the to the chart, how would that be done without having to Add all these extra people that are not gonna be seen just because there's a subscriber, I can put that information on the patient's chart. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: So in cases like this we usually have the option to add a non patient account since you mentioned that the father would not be coming in again so you would have to add. Agent: He's already in there, but he's a inactive. Patient: Yes, I understand. So it is because the patient is inactive that this is happening. Before we proceed, would you be able to provide me with the patient ID, the father's patient ID so that I can just check this from my side? Agent: OK, hold on. Agent: Let me get there real quick for you. Patient: And could you also provide me with your name please? Agent: Darrell Windler Patient: OK, thank you so much for the confirmation. Once you provide me with the patient, Idi will just be able to check a few things from my side. Agent: OK. Agent: I had, umm, didn't get. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: Who it was that didn't active? Patient: Are we still connected here? Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah. So it's ****-****-****, but again, he is the subscriber and he's no longer active. Patient: Yes, I understand. Patient: Yeah. Agent: And again, the question is how do I just add or no? How do I verify the insurance without activating his father again if he's not gonna be there? Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK, so in cases like that, when the father or any of the parent is, uh, is not a patient anymore, we have the option to add them as a non non patient into the system. So only in cases like that you will be able to use the same insurance for the dependents. So if the patients account is. Patient: Definitely. Mm-hmm. Agent: OK, well, I but I need you to walk me through that because that's not I I wasn't told that that can happen. So can you show me? Can you tell me and we can walk through it? Yep, I'm ready. Patient: Definitely. Would you be able to walk me, join me for a screen share so that I can walk you through the process? Agent: Yeah, let me so I'm not too. Agent: Uh, let me see so I'm not too loud. Let's see how far I can. Agent: OK, can you hear me? Patient: Yes, I'm able to hear you. Patient: It's not a problem at all. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: OK, I just, I ask a lot of questions and I don't wanna interrupt anybody of what I'm doing and but I need to make sure I understand and you walk through it with me. Patient: Absolutely so. Agent: OK, so I'm I'm gonna let you share my screen and and I just wanna write down step by step how I can do this without having to activate everybody's account, which makes no sense. Patient: I'll be more than happy to help you through this, and also once we disconnect the call, I'll make sure to send out the detailed e-mail with the steps to do the same. Agent: Yes, that would be great. Yeah, if I can get a e-mail too. OK, so. Patient: Mm-hmm. So would you be able to confirm the e-mail address for me as well? Agent: OK, you need my e-mail address. Agent: OK. Patient: Yes, the e-mail address for which you would prefer to receive the steps. Agent: OK, it's N as in Maureen Toy Sawyer. Agent: At ABCdental.com. Patient: OK, thank you so much for the confirmation and OK, could you please provide me with the screen share code? Agent: Umm, let's see. Let me see if I got it. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: I haven't received anything. Agent: In my e-mail. Patient: Are you referring to? Agent: OK. Patient: No, I have not sent out the e-mail yet, so I will be sending the e-mail only once we disconnect the call. Agent: What code are you asking for? Patient: So I was just updating. Patient: The screen share code. Patient: So once you. Agent: I don't have a screen shot code, where would I? Patient: Once you login to cash stack, are you able to see the three lines on the top right corner next to your name? Agent: Yes. Patient: OK, so when you click on that you will be able to see something called the SOS screen guidance. Agent: Oh, yes, OK. Patient: Yes, so you would have to click on that and a small file will be downloaded and you will also have the code that gets generated. So once the code is generated you can pass it on to me. Agent: OK. Agent: Umm, it's, it's thinking. Agent: Ready for connection? Agent: ****. Agent: 07/1. Agent: ****. Patient: So just to confirm, that would be ****, Am I correct? Agent: Correct. Patient: OK, thank you for the call and I'm just getting connected right now. Please allow me a few seconds. Patient: OK, I'm now connected to the screen. Would you be able to navigate me to the patients chat so that I can check a few things? Agent: Yes, ma'am. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK. Agent: So this is the J, this is the child that needs to be seen, young teen. But his dad, Calvin Kilback is the subscriber and he is the one that's not active. And so I need you to kind of walk through, walk with me through how you said, do that again so I don't have to activate everything. Patient: Mm-hmm. Sure. I'll be happy to help you. So before we proceed, would it be alright if I place you on a brief hold while I confirm a few things from my side as well? Agent: Yes. Patient: Thank you so much. Patient: And may I please take over the screen? Agent: Yes. Patient: OK. Thank you so much. Agent: That's crazy. Agent: Too easy. Agent: I would love to do it that way. Agent: I can't hear you. Agent: Hell, **** me, that's crazy. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Thank you so much for your patience. Hi. Patient: Yes, I'll be happy to walk you through. Patient: So. Agent: Hello, you. I see what you did. You were moving so fast. So if you could definitely just send me the stuff that I did, see how you just did that without having to do the extra. I really appreciate that. Agent: OK. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: I was just checking a few things from my side before walking you through the workflow so I wanted to confirm a few things which is why I placed you on hold. So right now, since the current insurance plan is already in the draft status, I believe that you will not be able to make the changes. The subscriber is already the inactivation account, So what you can do is you can delete the existing insurance plan. Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Patient: OK, which is in the draft status and you can click on Add new Insurance. So when you click on Add new insurance, you will have the option to select the subscriber. Agent: OK. Patient: So over here from the drop down you'll be able to select add new subscriber to the family and you can enter the details. So this account will be created as a non patient account and can be used as the insurance verification purposes. Agent: OK, so. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yes. Patient: That is correct. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: So instead of trying to activate Calvin Kilback's, I'm gonna go into there. Hold on. I'm sorry. Can we go back to the first screen? So I'm gonna delete, I'm gonna delete the the one that they have because they've already put it in draft. It doesn't allow you to do to move around like that. So then I delete, add the insurance and then we're gonna add the subscriber even though he's not a patient as a non patient account. Agent: OK. Agent: Now. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: So you can select Add new subscriber and enter the information of the father. Agent: OK, now. Patient: So once that is done, you can. Agent: Go ahead, Sorry. Patient: Yes, please continue. Agent: Go ahead, go ahead, finish them. Patient: That's not a problem once. Once you enter the patient details, you can verify all of the information details and. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: If you wish to add any other patients from the account family account to the insurance plan, you can select them from the check box over here. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And select the market insurance and verified and save the plan. Agent: OK so I need insurance verified. Agent: At the bottom. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: So we have the check box over here. Yes, the Bonnie Hane has verified. You'll have to click the check box over here. Agent: OK. Patient: So that would be once you enter all the information, the insurance plan details and select the members, you can click this box. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: And then you can click on save. Agent: OK, umm, what about? And then whose account are we on? We're on Darin Runolfsson right? Patient: Uh, we're on the. Patient: Sorry, the dependent, yes. Agent: Calvin Kilback So, OK, so let me ask you another question. Do I need to be on his account in order to add that to their account or can I be on the other people's account, the other family members? Agent: OK. Patient: You have to be on the child's account. You have to be on the account of whom you want to add the platinum to. Agent: OK, so OK, so this is I wanna do it to young team. So I'm so I do go to the show current patients insurance only. Patient: Yes, you'll have to click on. Agent: Do I need to click on that? OK, hold on, I'm I'm still. Patient: Yes, otherwise you'll be able to see all of the family members plans. Agent: Right. OK, so I need to click on show. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: Current patient. Agent: Insurance only, OK. Agent: Alright, and then. Patient: Mm-hmm. Then you click on Add insurance. Agent: So I don't delete that when I just add it or I do delete it. Patient: You you delete the existing one because you will not be able to make the changes to this one. Agent: Right. I see what you're saying. OK, OK, that makes sense. That makes a lot of sense. Agent: Anyway. Patient: So would you like to delete it right away so that we can walk through this? Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: Umm, yeah, let me just make sure I have all the information from the other one. Hold on. Umm. Agent: I just need to get their ID number so I can make sure I did it right. Patient: Alright. Agent: Umm, hold on, let me write that down so I can make sure. Agent: Umm. Agent: OK. Agent: So I am. We're gonna do. Hold on. I wanna make sure I got the. Agent: Let me sure I got. Patient: Yes. Agent: Yeah, because you see Marion Jakubowski and Young right there, they're gonna be seen, but Calvin Kilback's not on there, so we can go to Young's teams 1st. And so I'm gonna click right here, right? Agent: Right. And then. Patient: Mm-hmm. So just to confirm, would you like to delete the insurance plan for this specific patient as well, the ****? Agent: Can I do that at the same time? Patient: Yes, you will be able to click on Delete directly from here for both of the patients. Agent: OK, so. Patient: And since the father is an active, I believe you will be able to delete all three of the insurance plans and we can start fresh. Agent: Cool. OK. Agent: OK, give me two seconds. So now I'm gonna delete all of these. Patient: Yes. Agent: OK. Patient: OK, I can delete that as well. Patient: Perfect. Agent: And then I'm gonna go to. Agent: Add. Patient: Add insurance. Patient: Mm-hmm. Agent: Gonna put that in there. Patient: So under the subscriber details. Agent: Oh, right here. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: Yes, you can. Click on Add New subscriber to the family. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: And you can enter the details of the father's name and the date of birth, all the additional information required. Agent: OK, I think I got the hang of it. Patient: OK. Agent: Because I'm not doing this part of it my day yet, but I got all the information I need and I'll put that on there. Agent: And then I said. Agent: OK. Patient: Mm-hmm, I'll definitely make sure to send you an e-mail as well in case you have any confusion regarding the same. Agent: Thank you so much. Patient: Happy to help you. Agent: I know it was. I know he was doing this the hard way. Patient: OK. Agent: OK. Thank you. And you have my e-mail, right? Agent: Yeah. Patient: So moving forward, if you have, yes, I do have the e-mail.

Agent: You think? OK, Excuse me. Agent: Let's see. Agent: Well, first of all, I'd like to ask you, uh, one moment. Agent: What is your address? Patient: It is **** S Monaco Parkway. Agent: OK, S Ma. Agent: Is there a unit number? Patient: Apartment number ****. Agent: **** OK, one moment. Agent: Is that, uh, Denver? Patient: Yeah, yes. Agent: One moment. Agent: And what's the zip code? Patient: ****. Agent: Thank you. Agent: You moved, huh? Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yes. Agent: Thank you. Agent: Excuse me. All right, let's see. Agent: Alright. And do you still have, do you still have dental benefits to help you with your visit? Patient: Yes, the other dental PPO. Agent: And who's the subscriber, Lauren Fisher? Patient: Yes. Agent: And where? Patient: It's still the husband. Agent: Yeah, and he works at what company? Patient: Boeing. Agent: It's not Julia Witting anymore.

I just wanna make sure it's the same one we have in the system. Patient: OK. Agent: Take your time. Patient: Umm, the group, Group number, Uh, hi, it's ****. Agent: Perfect. Same one. Thank you so much. Agent: Alright, so let's take a peek here. So I wanna let you know to tomorrow, umm, Doctor. Jim Grady V has availability at umm 10:00. Can you make that? Agent: So so you're not in any pain. Patient: Tomorrow does not work for me on Friday. Excuse me, I have a question. Sorry. I I'm Lauren Fisher. Agent: What can I do for you, huh? Excuse me. I'm sorry. Patient: So yeah, I was checking on the Del Delta Dental website to find a dentist who's in network. Agent: Yes. Patient: And in the ABC dental practice they find like 3 dentists who are in network. There are a lot of others who are not in the network. Agent: Yes. Patient: So we wanted to like bring down the cost and visit it in in network dentist and uh, there are a couple of names, Misty Funk Julius Hackett and Marjorie Hermann Patient: Do you have the incentive for you? Agent: No, So, no. So we are not either one of those. No. Excuse me. So let me take a peek at the insurance. Is it a Delta PPO? Patient: Yes, it is Appo, yeah. Agent: OK. Is it appo slash premier that or or not? Patient: No, it's it's not premiere, it's just PPO. Agent: OK, we are premier only. Patient: OK, so that means that, OK, we'll have to more or less pay all of it ourselves. Agent: Well, not necessarily. If it's I'd have to take a look at the insurance. Do you want me to look at it? Patient: Yes, please. Agent: OK, hold on one moment. OK, hold on. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: OK Lauren Fisher, you guys, I would have to just umm so there I'm not able to get online for some reason, so I have to give him a call and ask for a fax back of benefits. That's the best I can do to find it. So umm. Agent: I mean, I don't know if you wanna wait, it might take a minute or call you back. Patient: I yeah, I, I, I. Either one works for us. Agent: OK. Agent: Because, OK, OK, hold on just a moment. Patient: Mm-hmm. So, yeah, we can wait. We can, yeah, also receive a call back. Patient: No problem. Agent: OK, guys. Sorry for the hold. So I unfortunately got somebody that was still, I got somebody that was still in training and I know everybody needs to start somewhere, but I just didn't have the patience. Patient: OK. Agent: So just to let you know, Lauren Fisher, so the difference would be roughly a 20% disc a difference. So yeah, that you would save more money and you know we have many patients that have. Agent: I'd say ****% of our patients come out of network to come see us. But yes, we would be. You would have to pay the difference between the PPO and the premier fee schedule. Agent: But you're able to come here and still get benefits, but you have a little bit more out of pocket. Patient: OK, so. Agent: Oh, sorry, Elsie Mueller Agent: Yeah, it's OK. Agent: Yeah. Patient: For a general examination, uh, sorry, hardly left. He went to pick up your kids. Uh, so for general examination, uh, and also the two that hurts currently, I think that needs failing or root canal. How much would I pay approximately out of pocket? Agent: I can't. You know what, it's an estimate I would guess about. Agent: So if it's ****, probably $****.00 out of pocket just for the exam and the X-ray only. That doesn't count for treatment. Patient: OK. And the doctors you have available for Friday, would he be able to do the treatment as well? Agent: No, we don't do root canals here. Patient: OK. Agent: So until we examine you, since it's been a couple of years, we will not know what you're going to need until the Doctor examines you. Agent: I have no idea. Patient: Ah, OK. Agent: So we would refer you to an endodontist for root canals. Or you could go and find one that participates in your PPOI. Don't know so. Patient: Umm. Agent: But we don't do root canals here. We do do crowns. We do fillings. But again, until the Doctor examines you, I cannot even begin to tell you what you need. I'm sorry. Patient: OK. Agent: I could tell you, yeah, that we're gonna do the one little exam and 1X roughly ****-**** dollars out of pocket. Patient: OK. Patient: Alright, so then let's look for Friday if you have time. Agent: We have 11 AM. Patient: I love you. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Oh no, that's tomorrow. I'm sorry. Let me go to Friday the 22nd. We have 8. Agent: 8:00 or 9:00 in the morning. Patient: 8:00 or 9:00 or one second. Just need to check my calendar. OK, Yeah, yeah. Patient: Friday. Patient: Eight 8:00 should work. Patient: Yeah. Agent: 8:00 OK let me see here 1 moment. Agent: OK. And it's at the six A, it's a Tennessee Ave. location, OK. And we will see you then Friday and try to get here a little early, maybe 15 minutes so you can complete your forms on our tablet here, OK. Patient: OK. Do you have an appointment at 8:30 maybe then? Agent: No, it's on the hour. Mm-hmm. Patient: OK. Agent: I can send you the link and you could do it at your leisure. It could Kayley_Christiansen@fakemail.com. Agent: So you can do the forms on, we send a portal and you have to do the forms yourself. Otherwise you come in about 10-15 minutes early to complete it on our tablet. Excuse me? Patient: OK so I already have booked an an appointment with the your office and DTC. Are you able to cancel that or I have to call them? Agent: Let me take a peek here. Hold on. Patient: That is for Friday 12:00. Agent: Yeah, let me get there real quick. Agent: Yep, I will. Let me take it off just a moment. Uh, cancel. Agent: Lower leftist is involved in here. OK, let me just see here. Patient: Yeah. Agent: So your lower left tooth, umm, what's being so it's hurting you for how long? Patient: It's hurting you. I the last 2-3 days it starts hurting a little bit. So it's still, I can live without any 10 kilos, but it's worth a bit. Agent: Mm-hmm. Now let me ask you, is it sensitive to hot or cold when you eat or drink something? Patient: No, I don't think so. Agent: That's good. Agent: OK, so we will see you Friday at the Tennessee Ave. location at 8:00 in the morning. Uh, it's **** or ****, OK. Agent: OK, sweetie.

Patient: Umm, you know, she, she quoted a price and and she quoted it several times because I had originally asked about it a year ago and six months ago. Whatever. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And one of the first things I said was I said these are crowns, but you know, I don't know the difference and don't care about the difference between veneers and crowns. Agent: Right. Patient: I said in my case, Doctor Levin thought the crowns are the way we should go. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: So I said to her, do I have? I said I have Delta Devil. I said like other times you've done my crowns, do I have any benefits? Agent: Yeah. Patient: She said. They don't. They don't cover that. Patient: And I said you there are no benefits. Patient: She said no. Patient: And maybe she was reading me to say to dental won't cover any of the of the work. Agent: OK. Agent: Hmm, OK. Agent: OK. Patient: But I just got 2 statements from Delta Dental that basically limited what the practice can charge me for all these crowds.

Agent: Yeah. Patient: And and I pay my, I pay my bills and you know, etcetera, etcetera. But if I have dental insurance and the insurance has contracts with you guys and the contracts basically limit the cost up or down of what can be charged, I wanna get the benefit of that because that's what I'm paying for.

Patient: The crowns that you send out to a different lab to manufacture. Agent: OK. Patient: Is there? Patient: Any appointment for that crown is anything freed up either Douglas Krajcikrrow or Friday? Patient: Right. Yeah, they said that. Agent: OK, so Douglas Krajcikrrow they just give you one hour. So she would not be able to do the actual crown. I don't know if they mentioned that to you. OK, OK, perfect. And Friday, let's see. Agent: She is pretty booked Friday and then next week umm she usually don't work on Monday so let's see Tuesday. Agent: Umm, I could do Tuesday. Patient: Is there any chance that? Patient: Umm. Patient: Any chance that something could? Patient: OK, because this it's really uncomfortable. Agent: Yeah. Patient: This part of the crown just cheered off. Patient: And I have the piece I would. Patient: But nothing is freed up for someone to just glue that back in this afternoon. Agent: Oh no, we actually close at 4:00. Agent: Umm, and she is already in the surgery right now. So I would just come when you come Douglas Krajcikrrow. That's the earMr. Trevor Wunsch MDest that we can see you and just talk to her. She see what she can do about if you need more appointment. Patient: OK, well, umm. Patient: How long do you how long do you book for a crown appointment? Agent: If we do everything in here, we don't have to send it out to UMM. Agent: To a lab, it's usually just two hours. Agent: Yeah. Patient: About two hours. OK umm, so what's your next available? So N not a not a possibiMr. Trevor Wunsch MDty to squeeze me in on Friday. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK. Agent: Well, uh, she's booked, but again, when you come Douglas Krajcikrrow, our schedule change all the time. Who knows, maybe by then may, maybe she has something or umm, they can call you if something come up, uh, available and uh, yeah. So I would just wait till Douglas Krajcikrrow and then, umm, you know, I'm sure she will figure something out for you. Patient: OK. And then umm for? Patient: As far as umm. Patient: Next week, but would we be looking at? Agent: She has time. Patient: Should we go ahead and should we go ahead and put something on the calendar or or wait? Agent: I would just wait.

Patient: Well, I've got an 11:00 already. I'm just wondering if we should put a placeholder. Patient: For that first appointment in the morning on Tuesday. Agent: Uh, weekend, 7:00 AM. But I don't know. Again, uh, if you don't need it. Agent: Umm, so you think you need umm, redo a crown? Patient: Well, so the story, the story is. Patient: Umm, when I came in in July, umm, the plan. So I, I'm finishing up umm, a Mr. Trevor Wunsch MD InvisaMr. Trevor Wunsch MDgn treatment and we knew that my as #2 tooth needed a crown and it was kind of a question mark whether 18, which is the one I'm having a problem with now. Patient: UMM needed to redo a crown and the UMM. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: She called it a permanent, temporary, umm, withholding so well, and she thought we could, you know, it had lasted. Patient: Umm, I, I don't remember how long now, but uh, it was doing well and she was Mr. Trevor Wunsch MDke, I think we could probably get away with not doing that. Patient: And so it turns out we probably should have. Well, we know we should have redone it, so I know I'm gonna have to have that one redone. Agent: OK. Patient: So. Agent: Yeah, I mean, again, if you and I could put you on the 26th, uh, uh, she has two hours in the morning. Umm, we can start 7:00 AM. Patient: OK, on the 26th. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK. And then if we need to move that Douglas Krajcikrrow, we can do that, but at least I'll have. Patient: Umm, placeholder. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK. Agent: OK, uh and, uh, the number 18 then. Patient: It's yes #18. Agent: Neighbor, I think that we're gonna do OK. Alright, perfect. So. Patient: And she's in, she's in umm, in a procedure right now. Agent: Yes. Patient: OK. Agent: Yeah, I am sure they did. Yeah. Patient: Well, we could just get a message to her. Maybe your colleague already passed a message along that Crown fails. I was. Patient: I was scheduled to get these aMr. Trevor Wunsch MDgners off on and be done with treatment be done with the InvisaMr. Trevor Wunsch MDgn on September 2nd, but I called the orthodontist and have them put a hold on making the retainer so. Agent: OK. Patient: You know to wait to get scanned after this one's done so. Patient: OK. Agent: OK, yeah, just review the appointment you and I made on Tuesday, see if she's, uh, that's still OK. And if for some reason change, yeah, they will help you Douglas Krajcikrrow to change it. Agent: OK. Patient: OK, well and if, if umm you know if you have on the message that if anything opens up Douglas Krajcikrrow, umm or Friday. Agent: Or Douglas Krajcikrrow. You're gonna be here first thing in the morning. Patient: For a crown, I mean if something opens up for a crown. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Patient: OK, will do. Agent: Right, right.

You know, uh, you just have to say I, I did set up appointment on Tuesday. If they see you on let's say Thursday or Friday, make sure they cancel the 1:00 on Tuesday. That's it because you blocked two hours of her. Agent: Umm I just reserved 2 hours of her time so I just wanna make sure if you do it on Thursday or Friday and I'm not here Thursday and Friday, that's why if you happen do it on Thursday and Friday, just make sure they will cancel the Tuesday, OK?

08/21/2025 10:56 PM,"Patient: Dental designs This is Remington. How can I help you? Patient: Yeah. Agent: Hi there. My name is, uh, Doctor Vicky Windler I'm working at Glendale, Colorado here and I have a case that I'm working on with precision oral surgery. That's Doctor Dr. Wallace Connelly Umm, the patient's name is Kelley O'Hara and he had scanned him, he said back at the end of June. Umm, And I just wanted to touch base with you guys in terms of next steps in a couple different options if available. Patient: Sure. Umm, it does. I see the record of us doing the conversion. Uh, let me just confirm we have those scans you took in June. Patient: Said Kelley O'Hara. Agent: Yes. Patient: OK, I don't see him in our folder, but sometimes, umm, you know, they take him and his team just, umm, doesn't we share a OneDrive, umm, with him? But if he said they took him then I, I'll just reach out from the office and get him. But umm, yeah, what are your questions? Agent: Yeah, he did take him, he said back in June. So maybe they might be deeper in your drive too, umm, as a possibility as well. Umm, with that case we're kind of doing a half arch. Patient: OK. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yep. Patient: OK. Agent: Hybrid sort of situation, I currently have them in the like same day or next day PMMA, and then we're going to kind of the next stage hyper uh, prosthesis, obviously same PMMA, and then we'll go to the final zirconia. We have another tooth that's in question #8 and I'm wondering, umm, my hope is that you guys can go ahead and fabricate the next umm. Patient: Mm-hmm. Patient: Yep. Agent: Version for me so I can trial that in UMM, but I wanted to see if I can fix. It's currently 2 through 7 and I wanted to see if I can deliver that and also prep #8 at the same time. My concern is that number 8 is not restorable and I'm wondering what are the kind of options for adding eight as a Pontiac and how I would go about that if I needed to do that. Patient: So, umm, we definitely can add it as a product and umm, because this is a mini and there's umm, some other teeth that the team can kind of use as landmarks if you umm, end up extracting. Patient: 8 Basically you would just remove the umm prosthesis the two through what's currently 2 through 7, and then just do a full arch scan UMM and then the team can basically redesign. Patient: The two through 7 and then add upon it and they'll have that tissue site, umm, at #8 there if it'll actually be similar. If you do end up crowning #8 umm, if you get that crown on, then you just scan it with the crown on in the bridge off. And then that kind of, that scan becomes sort of the contact tooth, umm, if it, you know, changes slightly from from his current number 8 situation. Patient: Yeah. Agent: OK, if it doesn't change much umm, then I should be OK with the final one going to Zirconia and then I guess question for scanning it, umm? Burnham scanned it in his office with the ICAM. I don't have that, so am I just? Agent: Implants, right? Agent: OK. Patient: You don't need that. That would just, that's really for, uh, implant position. Yep. So you would just do an iOS scan. Agent: And I just take it off and I can just leave the multi unit abutments and scan those. Agent: OK. Patient: Yep, Yep. And like I said, between the other teeth, umm, and you know, I'd capture as much, you know, if your team's doing it like the palette, as much information as possible because I'll just give the team more essentially landmarks to marry up the old scan with the new umm, And then that, like I said, we'll show them the tissue relationship of a if they're adding umm, A ponic there. Patient: Yeah. Patient: Yep. Agent: Got it. OK, do I need to submit umm as this is kind of a middle ground one, Do I need to submit a lab form online? Just the OR online ordering? Cool. Patient: Yep. Have you done the online on our website before? Agent: Yes. Patient: OK, so, umm, it's the same, but we did add a mini so it's, umm, instead of, you know, you'll go to the full arch area, but then it will ask like, is this a mini or a full arch? And if you click mini, umm, then it will just kind of prompt like which teeth? And then in that case, if we do need to add 8 when you go through it this way, then you can kind of select like now it's gonna be two through 8. Uh, but it's the same process that you're familiar with. We just added that many sections since we seem to be doing more and more of. Agent: Got it. OK, so I'll be doing this mini. Umm, how long does it usually take for that turn around on the mini? Patient: Umm, it's normally 10 days in lab. Umm, minis, you know, we can usually get done a little quicker. So if you need it a little quicker, we can definitely, you know, shave a couple days off. Agent: And that's just even for the the prototype. Patient: Yeah, Yep. And then the final umm, I think the final minis they need also 10 days in lab as opposed to the zirconia full arch they need that they would like 3 weeks. But like I said, I think with the minis and because we're doing the mini local here, umm, we can, we can do them quicker for you. Agent: Yeah, that would be great. I mean, if we could get that mini that way I can figure out what's going on with eight, you know, as soon as possible. Umm and then. Patient: OK, when would you like it? Agent: I mean the fastest. I guess you guys could turn it around for me would be awesome. Patient: OK. Agent: So I I'll defer to you. I know you gotta get that scan and stuff too with the with what's reasonable for you guys? Patient: Yeah, umm, I mean, I would say do you work for? Is your office open Fridays? Agent: Yeah, yeah. Patient: Umm, I would say we could have this back in your office next Friday. Umm, and then I'll reach out to Doctor Burnham's staff and see about, umm, you know, just confirm that they submitted those scans onto our shared drive since I don't see them yet. And then, umm, that'll give us enough time to get the scans and get going on the case. Agent: And then once I try in the mini, say I put this mini in, I repair #8 we get this thing rock'n'roll and I'm happy with it, and I basically want to go to Zirconia. Umm. Agent: I mean, how long do you recommend trialing the mini hybrid kind of prototype? Agent: It's pretty much good to go, right? Patient: It's really up to you. I, I personally think if it drops in and, you know, patient's happy with the aesthetics, you're happy with the tissue adaptation and the bite, I think you could order a final right then, umm, I think, you know, for yeah, I mean, if it checks all the boxes, I umm, you know, I don't see any reason to wear it. Patient: Or need to wear it and get them back in. I know some doctors let them go 2-3 weeks. Umm I think you know, depending on the patient and if they have complications or even the patient is having a hard time finding their bite on a full arch case. Like yeah sure you know they should probably wear it for a while. Patient: Umm, but for a mini, if he's been in it and hasn't had issues, uh, with what was delivered day after surgery, I think like I said, if you see this one and you're happy with, you know, fit and you get #8 figured out, umm, I would say you could just order the final, you know, right then. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Patient: Yep, Yep. Agent: OK, great. Awesome. Well, cool. I'll, I'll get this thing submitted and then, umm, I'll schedule not next week, but the following week. If you guys can get it by Friday, that would be amazing. Umm, and then I don't know what shade Burnham had originally chosen, so I'm just gonna probably write on there. It's probably like an 8/2. Patient: Umm, looks like we did a A2. Yeah, we did a A2. Agent: Yeah. OK, cool. We'll keep with that. Patient: And if that looks pretty good, then we'll, we'll do that. And then when you get to the final, umm, you know, you could pick, oh, if that is like not a perfect match, umm, then you can pick it. We're a little limited on the minis or on the temporaries. We've got basically like a 2A3A1 and a Bleach, uh, for final they could, do, you know, if you wanted like A1M2 or whatever to dial it in a little closer, we could do that. Agent: With Zirconia. OK, great. Patient: Yep, with the final Yep. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Do you recommend with the minis using UMM? Last question for you, like using the umm like metal framework in it? I know sometimes it's an option for the full. Agent: OK. Patient: We, it is still an option. I really, I don't see that very often for the meetings. And I think it's more of, you know, if you had a patient that was breaking, umm, their, you know, their conversion a lot or we kept having to redo temporaries. I would say maybe we evaluate for a bar. Uh, or if you had, you know, a big like if, if the number 2 was like, say two and three weren't supported and the implant was at 4:00 and we were hanging. Agent: OK. Patient: Off 2 and 3 then I would recommend a bar, but umm if that's not the case then I think like I said, if he if he hasn't broken his what was delivered for that conversion several months ago, that I think he's gonna be fine with the final without a substructure. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Excellent. Well, perfect. Thanks so much for your time and if something comes up with UMM Burnham's office, let me know. Patient: OK, will do. Agent: Have a great day.

Agent: I'm good. So you California, you. Yeah, I I'm sure I know what you're calling about, which is totally fine. Go right ahead, Miriam Reinger Well, umm. Patient: I'm gonna put you on speaker cause Elmer Stehr right here with me. Can you hear it? Agent: OK, sure. Yes, uh-huh. Patient: So, uh, what did you think we're calling about Marco Batz Agent: What about the debit? So let me explain. So there is a credit on on her account of $****.****. Agent: Right now. Agent: So. Agent: Go ahead. Agent: Yes. Patient: Umm OK well I because I I had those 3 automatic payments scheduled. Agent: Yes, Yep. Patient: Uh, and the, and the last one was paid on August 15th, so you know, last week sometime. Patient: Oh, OK, so I. Patient: Oh great. Agent: So what happened was so when we made the agreement it there was, I mean it was we're estimating you know, over $****. Well, insurance paid over. Let's see, it says insurance payment over $****. So better than we expected. Yeah. So those automatic deposit, so when this, when the last one came out on ****, there was a balance of 3/14/50 the ****. So that's why there's a **** credit so. Agent: Umm. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Oh, well, that's fine, that's fine. Just keep, keep it in your bank because, uh, we're gonna be back there, of course. Umm, in fact. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Uh, that's a nice surprise about insurance. I didn't know that. So, umm, but what I was actually calling about was. Agent: Oh, sorry, go ahead. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Uh-huh. You bet. Patient: No, that's great. That's good news. I like good news. Thanks. Thanks. Patient: But what I wanted to talk to you about was whenever Agnes Lehner might be scheduled next. Umm. Agent: That's. Patient: She's in the middle, middle of the treatment. You know, she's gonna be having another implant or a couple of implants put in, I guess. Agent: Yes, Travis Raynor III she is currently scheduled with Doctor pillows for a follow up and to do a scan and to prepare for a surgical guide for her implants going forward. So and that appointment is on. Agent: Tuesday, September 23rd. Patient: OK. Agent: At 11:30. Patient: OK, 11:30 SO. Agent: Yes. Patient: Let me, I wAgnes Lehner talk to you, Marco Batz 'cause you notice what we've been with you guys a long time and, umm. Agent: Course. Patient: And I have worked with Doctor Santiago Cronin of course, who's, you know, been always been great and then Doctor. Leslie Jakubowski and now just kind of knew what Doctor Poulos. Patient: And she kind of likes Doctor Leslie Jakubowski better. Patient: So. Agent: OK, she's my Doctor. I just, she just put an implant on me yesterday. Patient: Oh great, so she. Patient: Yes. Agent: So anyway, just to share my experience with you and you know what, and thank you for calling. We would never know unless you let us and you know, unless let us know. So totally fine. So let me see. Agent: Oh. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: I mean, I, I like, I like Jeff Zemlak because he's a guy. I'm a guy. But I, you know, Agnes Lehner, Agnes Lehner just feels a little more comfortable with, with Doctor Leslie Jakubowski. And so I, I know you guys won't mind. I hope it doesn't hurt his feelings. But if it's OK for us to switch doctors in the middle of this treatment, we'd, we'd love to do that if we could. Agent: Happy, happy to to help. I mean always yes, we not an issue whatsoever. OK, so umm in regards to that. So this is on 6/17 so let's see. Patient: I know those two are kind of in your office on different days, but. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Every other they just switch. So let me ask it, if Elmer Stehr sitting there, would she be OK just doing this next post up with him because he did the surgery or does she wAgnes Lehner just immediately switch over? Because usually they like to at least it's just a follow up, uh, for him to take a peek. And it's mainly the assistant that does the, umm, the scanning. Patient: OK. Patient: Yeah. Patient: OK. Agent: Of, you know, going around. So if we could keep the 11:30 on Tuesday the 23rd, again, it's usually the assistant that does the scan anyway. Umm, and then proceeding that, we'll go ahead and schedule the treatment with Doctor Leslie Jakubowski, OK? Patient: OK. Agent: Yep, completely fine and she's amazing and she again she she's my periodontist as well. Agent: Yep. Agent: Oh, I can't hear you. Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, uh. Well, anyway, I don't wAgnes Lehner even get in the middle. You. You and Agnes Lehner both like her. Oh, darn it. Can you hear me now? Agent: No, I can't. Patient: Oh. Patient: Well, you know, yeah. Patient: No. Agent: I know you said you just didn't even wAgnes Lehner get into it, just said and that's fine. Is there an issue here or other than I OK, just wAgnes Lehner make sure. Patient: No, no, no, no, no, not at all. It's just umm. Agent: Just her preference and that's why we're happy to oblige. Absolutely. Agent: She's a patient. Mm-hmm. Agent: Yes, she is. Patient: Yeah. And, uh, and Doctor, Doctor Leslie Jakubowski's fine with that, right? Kind of taking, taking over midstream of. Patient: You know, it was just keep taking out now it's gonna be did they already do bone graft and stuff, babe? Or yeah, they did when they pull it out. Oh, OK, so now it's just a follow up. Agent: Let's see, usually they do sometimes, not always at the time of the placement of the implant that's also added just depending on the bone level. So when we do that scan, she's get, uh, she's gonna be able to see that bone level to see if she needs to place any more bone at the time of placement. But we'll let you know, of course, along the way. So let me look at the treatment here uh. Agent: Let me see here. Patient: So that would they would determine that in the follow up and the scan on this on the September date. Patient: Perfect. Agent: Yes, once. That's once she could see that, yeah. So Yep, absolutely. Agent: So let me look here. So, yeah, back on 5/20 when Doctor Polis removed teeth, he put grafts in those as well. And then on 6/17, he put the guided tissue to, you know, preserve that site as well. So the next step, yeah, let's just have come in and with him and his assistant, uh, again, the assistant does the scan around that goes around your head. And then Doctor. Leslie Jakubowski will take a peek at that and probably that day. Agent: Umm, I'm here next. Agent: Uh, let's see next week and, uh, we'll go ahead and. Agent: Let me just look at something real quick. Agent: Oh, I'm here on the, uh, every Tuesday. Sorry, it's not until the 23rd, but umm. Agent: We can schedule with Doctor. Let me look at Doctor Leslie Jakubowski's schedule because right there they're gonna say, hey, let's go ahead and schedule the implant placement so. Agent: Let me see. Agent: Absolutely. Patient: See, I knew we needed to talk to you, Marco Batz You're the best. You got all this. You got all this stuff figured out. Agent: Yeah, I got you. I promise. Agent: Anytime. I'm just not here on Mondays. OK? Always know that if you will. Umm, so. Agent: If they say it's fine and ready to go, I mean, which they probably will, I mean Doctor Leslie Jakubowski has an appointment available at 10:00 on the 30th. Patient: Of September. Agent: I could of September, I could hold that or we go 2 weeks out from that. Patient: What do you think? Agent: Of course. Agent: Yes. Agent: September. Patient: Uh, well, wait, wait a minute. I'll have to check his, uh, schedule. OK, tell me that. What's the question again? Uh, Doctor Leslie Jakubowski has a. Patient: 30th, yeah. Patient: No. Agent: Doctor Leslie Jakubowski has an opening for surgery in the event that that, yeah, I think the next step is to do that. She's done everything else prior to surgery. Tuesday, September 30th at 10 for an hour and a half with Doctor Leslie Jakubowski. Otherwise we go 2 weeks out from there. Agent: Of course. Agent: Of course. Patient: Hang on one SEC, Marco Batz I'm looking at my schedule because I'm not required, of course, to be there, but I like to be with them if I can. Patient: Umm. Agent: So it's either that day or October 14th in the morning. Patient: September 30th or October 14th? OK, let me see. Agent: Yeah. Patient: September 30th is great. Agent: OK, let me go back. Patient: Yep, September 30th is great. Patient: OK. Agent: OK, and that would be at 10 AM. OK, I'm gonna place you, uh, you there, Agnes Lehner. For now, I am gonna reach out to Doctor Leslie Jakubowski so I could discuss this with her, uh, going forward. And it's completely fine. Everything's gonna be great. Promise. Agent: OK, Yeah. And if we're? Agent: Huh. Patient: Alright, Yeah, that's great. Thanks. And and you, you have 10:10 AM or 10/30/10? Patient: Yes. Agent: Go ahead 10 yes for an hour and a half. If for some reason this isn't a good day for the Doctor for some I I'm sure it's gonna be fine again after the 23rd we could she's gonna review the scan and go from there. But you'll have already been appointed this uh to come in to get the treatment. So if we need to move it out, we will. But for now, at least it's saved for you. Patient: OK. And she Doctor Leslie Jakubowski is the Tuesdays in the office, right? That's therefore September? Patient: Yeah. Patient: Oh, I see. Agent: Only so the period dot. Yeah, either one of them, Doctor Dr. Ismael Koch or Doctor Leslie Jakubowski, They they alternate every Tuesday. They will only be here on a Tuesday. Agent: Umm hum. Patient: I see. Well that's September 30th is good and if it needs to be pushed to October 14th, that's actually also good. I'm home on both of those dates, so. Agent: Oh look, look at us being proactive, huh? Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So either one works for us. And, umm. Patient: So, yeah, so but yeah, we'll just take it one step at a time. If you have us penciled in for the 30th now, that's great. If we need to change it to the 14th, we can, we can do that, I guess, right? Agent: And that's in the morning at 7:30. Mm-hmm. Agent: OK. Patient: Is that the only time on that day? Agent: Let me see, on the 14th, just because we are being proactive, Let's see. Agent: **** bucks. Agent: Other Oh, go ahead. Patient: Because we have kids in school. Well, we have school kids. There's no way we could do that time on foot. I mean, you know, hopefully the 30th will work at 10 because that. Agent: How far away do you guys live from us? Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah, **** minutes and yeah. Agent: Otherwise it's a 1:00 and you'll probably leave about 2:30. Agent: On the 14th. Agent: It is. Patient: Umm, OK, well that's kind of the back up plan, right? I mean the 30th right now it sounds perfect. 30th it. Agent: Let's just hope, yeah, I'm sure it's gonna be fine. But again, I just always, yeah, backup plan is right. Patient: OK. Patient: Alright. Agent: Let's just plan for the 30th. How's that? Agent: OK. Agent: Anytime, I'm here for you. Patient: Sounds great, Marco Batz Yep. Thank you. I we sure we appreciate you and and everything. So thanks, yeah. Agent: Uh, OK, you are so welcome. And then you got good news. Along with that, the **** is a credit on her account for the future treatment. Patient: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He, I called to schedule just a cleaning, I guess last time I was in. Oh my God, it was, it was like a year ago. I I holy cow. And it was with the lady named Raymond Muller But whoever I talked to said she's not available till next March. So they, they scheduled me with someone else. Agent: SH and now are you not on the schedule now or what? Agent: Hold on a minute, hold on. Patient: No, I'm not you don't. You have a magic, You have a magic wand. You can. Agent: I have a magic wand, actually. Mm-hmm. Agent: Umm, but yeah. Patient: Squeeze me in somehow, anytime in the next couple of weeks, I'm home for a week. Agent: Yeah, you're home for a week. Agent: Oh, OK, Mrs. Jessie Kohler Patient: No, for two or three weeks right now I I got. Agent: Now and Raymond Mulleronly. Or what if I do have an opening that becomes available with someone else just to get it done? Patient: Well, she, she tentatively scheduled me with, uh. Agent: Oh, let me see. Hold on. Patient: Some someone else on September 2nd. Patient: Which would probably be fine, but whoever did my cleaning last time was was I have. I just remembered thinking that she did a good job so I was hoping to. Agent: OK, let me. Patient: Stay with the same person but. Agent: OK, let me get into your file now. I just had to make that appointment. OK, let me see. Patient: Oh. Agent: Yeah, Raymond Muller umm, did. And I wAgnes Lehner let you know, and I'm just gonna tell you guys because Raymond Mulleris actually leaving in March or April. The end of April is her last day. The end of whatever the 30th. She's been here 13 years. It'll be 14 by then. She gave us nine months notice. Patient: Oh, well, that's, that's, I mean, that happens. I hopefully, yeah. Patient: Oh, well, that's, that's great. Oh yeah. Agent: She's she's just gonna be a mom. She's just gonna be a mom. So it's good that she can do that. Yeah. So. So I just wAgnes Lehner let you know that not to plan on it any further after. Agent: You know, a April of next year, so just let's see here, let's who see who did your cleaning previous to that. Agent: Well, you just have to find a newbie. Patient: Yeah, so that's what it sounds like. Well, she scheduled me with, oh God, I don't know, September 2nd that. Agent: At 11. Patient: 10 AM at 11, yeah, with someone I don't know, she said. But. Patient: OK. Patient: Yeah, that's fine. Agent: And that's with Marilyn Mraz Marilyn Mrazhas been here many years and she's amazing. So once you find your perfect fit, you let us know. But just stay there for now. Unless Raymond Mullerhas an opening. You wAgnes Lehner see her for one more time? It's up to you. Or you wAgnes Lehner get to know Marilyn Mraz You know what I mean? Patient: Yeah, it's probably better just do the person that's gonna be there again next time. So that's fine. Yeah, Yeah. Agent: Yeah, of course. So 11 AM on Tuesday, September 2nd, OK. Patient: Sounds great. Patient: Perfect, perfect. Agent: Alright dear, Alright. Anytime I can help, please don't hesitate, OK? Patient: Thanks, Marco Batz We appreciate you. Agent: OK, Bye you guys.

I was referred to practice, but they said just only use Dr. Dr. Dr. Jessica Nolan Nolan Nolan and Joy Gleason-Bailey Agent: Oh, OK. Patient: So at least I would like him. I really would like a good, good, good hygienist. Patient: MMM. Agent: OK umm yeah, I personally I know all our hygienists are good, but I can put you with one that will probably, umm, you know you'd be good with. It's just a matter of finding. I don't have anything earlier right now hygienist wise it would have to be after umm. Agent: August, I think my first available new patient experience appointment is like September 12 at this time. Patient: OK, what? What day of the week is that? Agent: Let me take a look. Patient: It's a Friday, I'm looking. That's fine for me. Agent: Yeah, that's a Friday, and I guess that one was taken. So let me keep looking real quick because with Doctor Sylvia Wuckert he's not in office on Fridays, so he's not in office on Wednesdays or Fridays. So Monday, Tuesday and Thursday are the best days, umm, to do with him. So give me one moment here. Agent: Yes. Patient: And I will say I have, are you at the office or you would like to call? OK, so I was a patient to run Lenco. Agent: OK, sure. Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Patient: For many years and when he sold the practice, I had one visit at your practice and it was way too big and way too impersonal for me and UMM. Agent: Yeah. Agent: Got you. Patient: Actually, I may have a 2. And I felt like I was Gentle Dental or, you know, perfect teeth. I don't want that experience. So my dear friend who's been using you forever said if you go to Dr. Dr. Dr. Jessica Nolan Nolan Nolan and use Sylvia Wuckert you're not gonna feel that. So I really would prefer a more personalized experience. Patient: Thank you. Agent: Yeah. And that's why I am looking with for a particular, umm, high, the particular hygienist I'm looking for, I'm trying to see. Yeah, of course, of course. Patient: And if you knew, well did have you been there a long time? Did you know Romp and Co? Agent: I didn't know him. I came in right after, uh, he left. Mm-hmm. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK. He was as personable and it was one-on-one. It was a small office. So I just it's more comfortable for me that way. Patient: Thank you. Agent: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I totally understand. So, umm, Oh yeah, of course. Unfortunately I am. We're just have been very fully committed. I'm looking out into October right now on the days that Doctor Vicki Lemke is in office and with this particular hygienist. Umm, so. Patient: Yes. Agent: Now, do you have a preference and time? Like do you prefer like mornings or afternoons or it doesn't really matter? Patient: You know what I need to get in SO. Patient: This first time if you can get me in. Agent: Yeah, OK. Patient: I don't care. Agent: OK. Patient: I mean I made, I canceled, aren't there? Isn't there cancellation Larry Considinet? Patient: Great. Patient: Yeah. Agent: There is, we can put you on the priority Larry Considinet. Things do happen all the time where stuff opens up. So I where I place you, I don't feel like you'll stay. It's just a matter of umm, you know, the times the openings usually happen closer to like umm, the day of or a few days before. So, but yeah, I'm sure we'll be able to get you in sooner. Patient: OK. Agent: OK. Patient: So and what do? What do we have even talked about the date? Agent: Yeah, I'm going backwards now a little bit. Agent: Because I saw one and then I lost it. Agent: OK. Agent: No, that's not who I want. Agent: OK, so right now I'm looking at Thursday, October 2nd at 9:30 in the morning and I'll put you on the priority Larry Considinet. OK, Larry Considine. Patient: OK, so oops, let me just change my appointment. Patient: Umm, so it's supposed to come in the 26th? Patient: And I'm moving that to. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Thursday. Agent: October 2nd. Patient: I need to check one thing. Agent: OK, sure. Patient: What time is it at 2:30? Wait, is it at 2:30? Agent: ****. Agent: OK. Patient: MMM, that's OK. We'll just leave it by the load. Patient: OK, dear. Agent: OK, alrighty. And I'll put you on a priority Larry Considinet. I'm sure we will be giving you a call to see if we can get you moved up, OK. Agent: Of course. Agent: OK.

Patient: I'm calling to double check about my new insurance. Patient: Coverage. Agent: OK umm 1 moment. What's your name? Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And last name is Kippers. There's four of us on the Lonnie Torp Ve policy. Agent: OK. And what were your questions? Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: So our my question is the two of us, two of the four went to get our teeth cleaned, Ann Ankunding and Alyssa Koepp Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: And, uh, that was after the policy went into effect. I just got a new job, so it's part of my new job coverage. Umm, we, we're with Blue Cross Blue Shield dental. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Umm, and. Patient: So I think when Lonnie Torp V and I both got our teeth cleaned. Patient: I think we weren't sure whether my my insurance will cover all of the services or not. So it was there was a question about that. So now I have talked to my insurance. I think they covered my my cleaning. Patient: My claim? Patient: So I wanna check on that and also I wanna check on Lonnie Torp V because he's on the Lonnie Torp Ve policy, so I'm assuming they would cover his as well. Agent: Umm OK, let me see. Patient: I spoke with Ignacio Reichert-Weimann I think last time, it was a couple of weeks ago, so we were in touch about that. Agent: OK, let me see. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: Umm, for some reason it wasn't for you. It was submitted to insurance, but for Lonnie Torp V it didn't go to insurance yet. So I'm gonna change it right now and submit it to insurance. I would give it about 7 to 10 business days to process. OK. Patient: OK. And for me, I I paid in person for my. Patient: Cleaning, can you guys credit back? Patient: Whatever I paid. Agent: Umm, so for your account balance it let me check and see, OK? Patient: Uh-huh. Agent: As of right now, there's no balance in your, uh, on your end or a credit on your end. It's showing that insurance. Agent: UMM did not pay anything for your visit on 8/4. Agent: Umm, let me see why. Patient: So what claim I guess was processed? I don't I don't understand. Agent: For your visit on 10 uh on August 4th. Patient: Right, so you're saying my insurance did not pay the claim? Agent: Yes, they didn't pay any of it is what it's looking like. Let me check and see what their reasoning was. 1 moment. Patient: They told me they paid ****%. Agent: Umm, I'm seeing on my end, uh, insurance. We expected that they wouldn't pay and then they paid nothing. So let me check and see what their reasoning was. 1 moment. Patient: Hmm, yeah, I'll have to call him again. Agent: Let me just verify that it's the Blue Cross Blue Shield, correct? Patient: Yeah, Mm-hmm. Agent: OK, can I verify the subscriber ID with you? Patient: Sure, let me see. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Yeah, they said that we are allowed twice a week a year with Doctor visit, you know, with the appointment. Patient: Plus cleaning. Umm, it would be covered completely. Let me see.

08/22/2025 3:25 AM,"Patient: Hello. Agent: Hi, Dr. Lester Beahan I have Doctor Debra Nicolas here, OK. Patient: Hi. How's it going? Agent: I have Doctor Cana. Give me one moment, OK? Patient: Sure. Agent: OK. Patient: Hello. Agent: Hi there, Dr. Lester Beahan How are you? Patient: Good. How are you? Agent: Umm, so Iris was just telling me that you're at the Reaching Out specialist office and he thinks that other tooth can be saved? Agent: OK. Agent: OK. Agent: X-ray. Agent: Yeah. Patient: Yes, so that's the thing that basically he said that he can do the root canal of tooth #**** right now. So I'm waiting like **** minutes. And then he said that he thinks that ****% chance to save the other tooth to kind of try in two different sessions. And then he he say like that a lot of the success depends also on the qual the crown. Patient: OK. Patient: Yeah. Agent: Yes, and that's what I'm worried about, the root canal. I don't think it's gonna be a problem. I think he can do a root canal for you no problem at all. My concern is I don't actually think we're gonna get a good quality crown on there, and that's what I'm more worried about. Do you remember when you came in yesterday? We in the morning we were talking about we could try to save it with a root canal and crown, but I do think eventually you're gonna end up having to pull it anyway. Patient: But why do you think, uh, why the clown is not good? Agent: Because where the tooth has broken and how the gum tissue has grown over, My worry is that I can't get a good seal. The second part of that is on the actuary that I have the break in the tooth and the cavity in the tooth has gone all the way down to the bone. Which means you need an additional procedure, something called crown lengthening. And in order to do crown lengthening, I basically have to make space for the crown to even cleanly attached to the tooth. So instead of just doing a root canal and crown. Agent: We're also going to end up needing something called crown lengthening, and that basically is reshaping the bone around the tooth so that way we can have a nice clean attachment of the crown. Patient: OK. Agent: Does that make sense? Patient: So you still think that the extraction is the best thing to do? Agent: I mean, it's honestly up to you at this point. I'm happy to try a crown for you. I just want you to be aware that I'm giving it kind of a **** shot, if that's even gonna last. That's my concern. You know, if it's not gonna last you long term, then do you wanna go through the trouble of doing it? And if you do, then great, I'm happy to do it. And to be honest, if it was my tooth, I think I would try with the full knowledge that I might end up losing that tooth in a year to five years anyway. Patient: OK. And the extra job of is like making the room for the crown? Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: The extra job that you're saying and that's another procedure that we have to do. Patient: Hmm. Agent: It, it is and it is another surgery type of procedure. So you will have stitches, you will be sore. Umm, that one is a little easier in the sense that umm, there's not a hole in your mouth, right? Like when you remove a tooth. The only thing with that procedure though, is you're gonna be more limited in your diet for about two weeks time. And the second part of that is I can't put the permanent crown on until the gum and bone. Agent: Umm, tissue around that crown heels so you can't put the crown, the permanent crown on for two weeks. Agent: About two weeks. Patient: So wait so basically what about tomorrow? Like can you put a permanent crown when I before I leave to the tooth #**** or no? Patient: OK. Agent: For ****, yes. For ****, uh, that is no, because at the very least you're gonna need to be in a temporary for a couple of weeks. Patient: OK, so that I either do the root canal and do the crown in Italy, right? Agent: Right. Patient: Or I'll do the just the extraction and that's it. Agent: Absolutely. And you know what I could do for you if you get the root canal on that tooth as well, I can put a temporary crown on that for you so you don't have a big hole there. Agent: However, I want you to be aware that is temporary. When you get back, the second you have time, you need to have it replaced because it's not gonna be a perfect seal because it is a temporary crime. Agent: Yeah. Patient: And even if and even if I get a good permanent crown, you still think that I have a chance to lose that tooth in one year? Agent: Not necessarily in one year. It's hard to predict for sure, but I, you know, my gauge is usually if I can make something last five to 10 years, that's what I'm looking for minimum, right? This tooth is questionable. It's there's a ****% chance it will. There's a ****% chance that it won't, mostly because we have to do extra procedures to even get a crown on the tooth. Patient: OK, OK. Agent: That's my only concern from a from a crown standpoint. From a filling crown standpoint, I worry that we're not gonna be able to give you a proper seal. Agent: OK. Agent: That I can do, yeah. Agent: Yep. Patient: OK, let me see how it goes today and then tomorrow morning we'll see you at 9, where hopefully we can put the permanent crown on tooth #**** fix the fix the cavity as we said, and then I don't know. And then we'll think about either the extraction. I don't think that we can do tomorrow too, right? We have too many things, I feel. Patient: No. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: We have too many things since we're adding the crown. But what I can do is let's talk about this too. Since you're not getting the reconnault today anyway, when you come in tomorrow, let me show you on the X-ray exactly what I mean about a proper seal. Because when I show it to you, I think it'll make more sense. And I'm glad the specialist thinks that, yes, original will work. The original will work in the infection standpoint. I just don't know. Agent: If that's gonna be best solution because we don't have a proper seal. Agent: And I'll show you. Mm-hmm. Agent: No. Patient: OK, he said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I just said that there. He he said it's not infected, which I thought was weird. OK, that's not effective. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: No, it's not infected. It's there's a cavity there, which are two different things. I know they get mixed up all the time. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Yeah. Agent: OK. Agent: Yes. Patient: Alright, OK, let's talk tomorrow and so far I'm doing ****. Alright, in a few minutes I'm gonna start and then. OK, tomorrow we can definitely do the cavity and possibly the crown too, I guess. Or maybe we can remove the tooth and do the crown now. What is best now? Maybe better do the crown and then. Agent: And the fillings. I would do the fillings and the crown so you don't have to do more procedures later. Patient: And then maybe the tooth extraction on Tuesday if it's not tomorrow. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. Agent: Yes, and, and we'll talk about that too, because if you decide you wanna do the root canal and you want something else there, then I can, I can do that too. And I can accommodate that on Tuesday as well. I just wanna make sure you're informed on the, on the good and bad of doing either option. So when you come in, we can talk about that more in length with pictures and the X-rays and it'll make a little more sense too. Patient: OK. Alright. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow. Patient: That sounds all good. Agent: You're so welcome. I know I kept you waiting. Sorry about that. Umm, I was just with a patient. Patient: Sure, sure. Sure. Thank you so much. See you tomorrow.

If we get it in this week, we'll give you a call. Agent: OK. Patient: When OK Umm. Patient: Have they called the lab? Patient: And asked. Agent: They've yeah, well, they've submitted the everything to the lab. We just have to wait for the lab to get that made and then get that shipped here.

But the person who does everything with the lab, Nick Towne I talked to her directly and she said they've submitted everything but they haven't gotten anything back. Agent: OK. Patient: Yeah, OK, Well, I understand that information. What I don't understand is that Travis Wiegand or Doctor Vicki Lemke said they would call yesterday and tell me what they, you know, they were going to call the lab and talk to them about it. So I would like to get a follow up from Doctor Pratt or from Travis Wiegand. Agent: OK. Patient: Umm, you know when? As soon as I can to find out if we could schedule an appointment for me next week.

I but I yeah, I can't even know what Doctor Vicki Lemke. But I did talk to his assistant and she said that we can't schedule anything without having the crown here. Because if we schedule it and you come in and the crown's not here, then there's nothing we can do until the crown gets here. Umm. But I can leave a note with Mr. Vicki Lemke and see what he says Monday. Agent: OK. Agent: Yeah. Patient: OK, OK, alright. I'd appreciate that. Just to let them know it matters to me that I get it set before Friday. So I hope, I hope they understand that. I think they do. Agent: OK, I'll leave a note with them. Patient: Thank you. Bye. Bye.

08/22/2025 10:35 PM,"Agent: Good morning. Thank you for calling ABC Dental. This is Ira Rowe V How can I help you? Patient: Hello, good morning. Do you have an outstanding balance that I want to get some information about it? Agent: Mm-hmm. What's the name? Patient: Geran, CEREN. Yeltsin, YALCIN. Agent: OK. And what's the balance amount for? Patient: I'm not sure what do you see in the system. Agent: OK, it looks like statement of **** dollars. Agent: Mm-hmm. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Right, sounds right. So it seems like there has been some issue with the insurance at least. I'm not sure if this is like a one visit or a accumulation of a few visits. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: But I assume one of the visit has a large amount, even not all of them. Patient: Uh, can you see that one? Is it coming from one visit or a combination of a few? Agent: It's coming from a few different visits it looks like. Umm. Agent: Let's see real quick. Give me just a moment. Agent: $**** of that is coming from a visit that she had on April 8th. Agent: And then the remainder of that is coming from a visit that was on March 28th of this year. Patient: OK, OK. Patient: So this March and April ones, can you see which insurance company did you guys? Patient: Communicated with those two visits. Agent: Let me see. Agent: Umm, so we have two insurances on file. We have Cigna Dental and we have Delta Dental of Colorado. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: OK, that's the problem, I think. No, that's not. That's not a problem. It caused a problem. Patient: My understanding is. Agent: Mm-hmm. OK. Patient: So you have two in the system, OK, what what does it mean? Can you help me to understand? So like let me explain to you then maybe a little bit better. So we were in Cigna in my previous employer that in February, right? Patient: Late February, we I changed employer and we moved to the other one from Cigna to the Delta 1 right. Agent: OK. Patient: And then, you know, I talk to you guys as soon as we make this change. Patient: For #1 question, should we remove Cigna? Agent: Do you have that insurance anymore or is it you don't have it anymore? Patient: For like. Patient: You can also quickly check as well. Patient: Uh, let's say my visits. This is my wife, right? My visits. I have visits, uh, since then, I believe. Patient: I'm just curious why my wife had this problem with the insurance but I didn't have. I have also visit after this employer change but I don't have these issues. You know my insurance I don't know who covered but somebody covered my visits. Patient: Umm. Agent: Umm, so do you? Do you have the Cigna insurance still or you do not have the Cigna insurance? Agent: OK. Agent: Uh-huh. Patient: N no, no, this is my with my previous employee, but that there was some period that both were like my previous employer, They didn't cut Cigna immediately, right? Whatever. A few months after I left my employer signal was there, but now it's not, it's not, you know, relevant anymore. But that's what it could cause the confusion, I guess. But yes, now me, my wife and our son, everybody under me are under doubt only not Cigna. Agent: OK, do you know when that umm, policy ended? Agent: OK. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Again, there was a maybe 2-3 months or something. My employment ended in February, but they I think they offer another three months or something, but it doesn't matter. In Melvin Berge Dr. Jeannette Powlowski I was with this Delta Dental and. Patient: Right. Patient: Right. Agent: So the the reason I'm asking is if you had two insurances at the time of her last visit still because your employer gave you an extra allotted time for that insurance, we would have to bill both insurances in the correct order. So if Cigna, you had Cigna and then you had Delta, Cigna would have been your primary insurance that would have gone through them and then gone to Delta. But if that was incorrect, then it wouldn't have gone through properly. You would have had to have called them. Agent: And let them know which one would be billed first. Agent: The end. Patient: Like cold hooks? Is that called delta or should I call Cigna? Agent: The insurance so you would call both of them and you would. Agent: Talk to them to establish which insurance was the primary at that time. Patient: And how about? Patient: Which one did you guys connect it after this Garry Farrell visit? Agent: Well, we have both insurances connected. We have the Cigna set as your primary and the Delta set as your secondary. Patient: OK. Patient: OK. And then none of them covered? Agent: Umm, let me see. Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: That's what I don't understand right? You go to Cigna, sure as a primary. Then they say oh we are not covering this you know person anymore. But then when you go to Delta they should say Oh yes we are covering this guy. One of them should cover either way if you communicated both of them. This is why I'm confusing. Agent: Alright, 1 moment. Agent: OK. I mean I can call Cigna and see when how long they were active for if they're still active. Agent: Umm, and see on that end. Agent: But I would have to. Patient: About the delta and. Agent: We, I mean we would bill, it would go through the first insurance and then it would go through the second insurance afterwards if that insurance was active. Patient: Right. Agent: When did you when was your did you get the delta insurance? Agent: Mm-hmm. Patient: Doubting that's what I'm looking at right now. My card says effective February ****. Agent: Mm-hmm. OK. Well. Agent: I can reach out to our insurance people and have them rebuild that for you and see if it goes through this time. Umm. Patient: I really appreciate that. Agent: OK. Patient: And how can I? Do you have an e-mail address or something in the system of my mine or my wife that you can just inform us? What's the outcome? Agent: Umm yes, we have both of your emails on file. Patient: OK, alright, if you can let us know how does it go, then we go from there. Agent: OK, we will do that.
